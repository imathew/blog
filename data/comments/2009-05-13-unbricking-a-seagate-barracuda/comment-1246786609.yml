  kavrron: If you went the RS232 route you''d have to add power because none is supplied,
  but USB provides its own power so I didn''t have to. I can''t help you out with
  wire colours, I''m afraid - it seems that any given USB cable uses different colours
  so there''s no way to be sure without testing it.'
