comment: 'michael: I attached the gnd without even thinking whether or not it was
  a good idea. It could have been disastrous, I have no idea. I have noticed that
  some people on the web have connected it and some haven''t, and I''m not knowledgeable
  enough to give you a definitive answer.


  It''s gaps like these that prevents me from putting up a complete tutorial. I don''t
  feel comfortable doing that when I''m not 100% about the process, so I''ve just
  documented my experience and if that assists people, great.'
