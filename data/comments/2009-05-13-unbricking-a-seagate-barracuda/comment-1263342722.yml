comment: 'I know this post is getting old, but after over a year my Seagate finally
  hit that dreaded 320 mark (or multiple thereof) I only recently found out about
  this problem when my HD quit working and I searched the net to find a reason.

  Anyways, I have downloaded the firmware update and putty. This leads me to the next
  step, the connection. My question is, do you think any cell phone data usb cable
  will work? I have plenty of old cd-rom cables in the basement.'
