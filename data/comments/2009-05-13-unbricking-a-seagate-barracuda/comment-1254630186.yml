comment: 'Hugh: I did specify that I used a DKU-5 cable. I''ve had one for years for
  use with my old Nokia phone. I wasn''t aware that it was Chinese or otherwise; I''m
  in Australia and it''s simply what was available.


  I have no experience doing this with any other cable so I can''t help you. You could
  try asking your question in the forum thread I linked; it still seems to be active.
