comment: Dan S, and the rest of you, i have better advice, bring your HDD to i356
  (A Seagate Company), they flash your drive for free, because of the FirmWare Epic
  Fail, and it won't void warranties. I mean, free, and all the mess and work less.
  So don't do this and just go to i365, or let your local mail service bring it, wich
  is also free.
