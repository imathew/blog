comment: 'Hello, Mathew and other experts:


  My Seagate hard drive (2 GB, green, Barracude) seems to have the firmware problem,
  i.e. the hard drive is not recognized by BIOS. I can feel that it spins as normal.
  There are some posts on the web on restore the hard drive from the busy state to
  normal state.



  First, I remove the star shape screws of the hard drive PCB. Then, insert a piece
  of paper on top of the read/write head connector and the PCB board.


  When I connect the hard drive serial RS-232 port to a USB-Serial adapter at a PC
  USB port, connect the SATA hard drive power cable to a PC and the hard drive, it
  shows in my PC putty terminal window (38400 baud, 8/1 bit, no parity, no flow control):


  Boot 0x40M

  Spin Up




  then, I feel the hard drive stops spinning. There is no communication any more.
  Of course, it does not respond to Ctrl+Z command. I suspect that it goes to a protection
  mode from other on-line posts. There is only one procedure I am not sure. It is
  to insert a piece of paper between data SMT connector and PCB. Before un-assemble
  PCB for the paper inserting, hard drive motor spins forever after power it up. Could
  you tell me what is wrong?



  Thanks a lot
