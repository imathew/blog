comment: 'Going by your pinout it appears as though 6 is receive, 7 is transmit, and
  8 is ground. There doesn''t seem to be a standard for dku-5 wire colours, so the
  only way to be sure is to test them.


  I didn''t check for voltage but used Ohms to check for continuity. If you look at
  the multimeter photo you can see that I''ve switched it to the Ohm side, and by
  default the value (resistance) is 1. If I were to touch the probes together the
  resistance should drop to zero (or thereabouts). As you can see in that photo I
  cut the Nokia end from the cable and separated the wires. I then used this resistance
  method to check which wire matched which pin.


  It sounds like you have the right cable, so once you''ve found the Rx and Tx wires
  you should be about to tie them to each other, connect to the COM port (using putty
  or hyperterminal or similar), and whatever you type on the keyboard should appear
  on the screen (as the data loops back through the wires). You can then be satisfied
  that you have the correct wires, and can attach them to your hard drive. Keep in
  mind that the Rx and Tx needs to be reversed on the drive (because the drive will
  be receiving what the USB cable is transmitting!)'
