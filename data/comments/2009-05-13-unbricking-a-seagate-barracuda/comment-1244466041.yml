comment: 'Hi TW,


  Are you using a DKU-5 (or similar) USB cable? The required cable isn''t a regular
  USB cable but one containing the circuitry to create a serial signal. I used an
  old Nokia phone cable.


  When you insert the correct cable, Windows should detect it and ask for drivers.
  I was lucky - I bought mine from eBay and it didn''t come with drivers, but Vista
  detected and installed the correct ones (after automatically searching online).
  The cable then appeared as "USB-Serial Controller" in Device Manager, and listed
  the COM port number.


  As for your final question - yes, it was that simple for me. You''ll need to check
  that the cable is working correctly via the loopback method before you attach it
  to the hard disk, though. It sounds to me that you don''t have the correct cable,
  or the correct drivers haven''t been installed.


  Good luck!'
