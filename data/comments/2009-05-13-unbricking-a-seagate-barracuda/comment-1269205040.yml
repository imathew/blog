comment: 'Hi Mathew,

  I am trying to unbrick my hdd, but when I connect to Hyperterminal or Putty and
  enter Ctrl+z my com prompt shows F&gt; and I cannot access level 2. Any ideas? PS.
  I am using a Nokia Usb to Uart cable model CA-42 with drivers install, alsoo I am
  only able to communicate at a rate of 9600 instead of 38400.'
