comment: 'Hassiem: No, I have no idea. I was fortunate that it worked for me; I wouldn''t
  have been able to figure it out if I''d had problems.

  Trev: No, nowhere near Sydney :)

  MC: No, I don''t know anything more than I''ve said, I''m afraid.

  Meiko: I didn''t use that method, so I don''t know. Also, as I''ve said before,
  I can''t give you names of the wires because they vary from cable to cable. The
  only way to be sure was to use a multimeter.


  Sorry for the late reply, I''ve been away a while. Not that I helped anyone, anyway!'
