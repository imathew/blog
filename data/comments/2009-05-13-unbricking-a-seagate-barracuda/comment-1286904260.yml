comment: I followed the procedure above on my bricked 7200.11 with SD15 firmware,
  and the drive is again working. However, when I attempt to flash the drive with
  the corrected firmware, it shows up in that process as a 'ST31000340AS', instead
  of the ST3750330AS' that it really is. Is there something about the process that
  might have resulted in this situation? Goes without saying that the firmware update
  did not succeed, and Seagate Tech Support now reports that since I did this repair
  I have voided the warranty - jeez!
