comment: 'Thanks, Matt between this and a couple of other posts on this subject you
  have all given me enough information to do a successful recovery.


  The gotcha for me was the genuine Nokia CA-42 cable I was using needed 3v power
  so I hooked up the ground (black) to the negative and red (3.3V) to the positive
  of the cmos battery.


  After that it was just a case of swapping the RX and TX (Blue and white in my case)
  as the usb end was sealed so i couldnt find out which was which but swapping it
  is no prob.
