comment: 'Shawn: Maybe - if you plug a cable into your computer and Windows detects
  it and creates a new COM port for it (which you''ll see appear in the device manager),
  you''re halfway there. It would just be a matter of determining the correct Rx and
  Tx wires, then.


  Jeremy: In theory the data should be fine, because you''re not changing anything
  on the disk itself but unlocking a simple setting on the logic card. My data was
  fine, at any rate! Don''t rely on me, though - if you have crucial files to restore
  it''s probably safer to send it back to Seagate.'
