comment: 'In the link you posted there''s this "Powering the RS232-to-TTL Adapter".
  Do I need to do that using the dku-5 cable? I also have a dku-5 cable that i could
  use, but don''t have a multimeter...could you show which color of the wire goes
  to the jumper pins? I hope you could post a step by step complete instructions to
  follow because your version is easier to follow.


  Good job!'
