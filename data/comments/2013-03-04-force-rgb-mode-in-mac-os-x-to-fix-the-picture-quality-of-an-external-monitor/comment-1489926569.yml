comment: thanks for the reply :) Windows isn't really the dark side from my point
  of view, just kiddin', I'm using them both daily, and both have there own pros and
  cons. But Apple is multiplicating the cons with their current behavior, both on
  OS (more and more locked each release) and Hardware (better nice than usefull) I
  don't even talk about the prices... Anyway, thanks for your post, and to keep it
  alive :)
