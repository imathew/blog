comment: 'Thank you sooooo much for your assistance.  I just opened my new Dell u2913WM
  and couldn''t believe how crappy it looked compared to my "old" Lenovo Monitor.  I
  did some digging and someone suggested to turn sharpening down to "0" when in yPbPr
  mode but it still didn''t look OK.


  This fixed the problem, and although it is not a Retina Display, text is pleasant
  to look at in web browsers and mail.app.


  Cheers!!! (And thanks to the original script author, and the guy who forked/served
  it up).'
