comment: 'Hi guys,


  i''ve followed the steps exactly but the display still looks fuzzy. restarted my
  MBP twice and the results look the same. i''m using a Dell S2340Lc. Any advice?


  The override appears to have been registered when I go to Apple/About this mac/More
  info/"Graphics/display'''' as i see "Display with forced RGB mode (EDID override)"


  i am using a  2010 13" MBP, OS 10.6.8.


  Appreciate any help!'
