comment: Hi Zyg. The file you generated looks fine. I never closed the lid during
  the process. It's not needed. The problem is that Apple's DVI to Thunderbolt plug
  does not support higher resolutions than full HD (1920x1080). If you just get a
  regular DisplayPort (monitor side) to Mini DisplayPort (MacBook side) cable, you'll
  get it to work. See also http://daggle.com/macbook-run-2560-1440-monitor-2324
