comment: 'Just tested this myself with a Macbook Air m1. Same result.

  I have been using this script for years on my intel MACs, and worked fine.


  It appears the script needs to be updated for M1 macs. Who knows if the original
  author ever will tho.

  At this point, can just put up a big middle finger to Apple for excluding such a
  simple option from their display settings, "display full range" vs "limited range"
  UGH, so dumb.'
