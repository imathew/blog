comment: 'I tried the patch in Maverick on my macbook air 2013, it works but has very
  negative side effects : when using the profile with forced rgb, I lose the possibility
  to get the dock on the second screen (new maverick feature) and I lose also the
  dual screen settings shortcut on the menu bar... It rolled back by removing the
  forced rgb profile and all came back to normal. Do you know how to fix this ?

  Thank you very much'
