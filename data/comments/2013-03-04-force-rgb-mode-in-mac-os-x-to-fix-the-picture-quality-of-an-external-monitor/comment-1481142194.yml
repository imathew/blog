comment: "Hello! \n\nWill this procedure override the color space for any external\
  \ display? I have an external LG monitor to which I intend to apply this fix so\
  \ it forces full RGB... But I also occasionally connect my macbook to my living\
  \ room TV, which do not require full RGB. \n\nWill this fix be applied specifically\
  \ to the display connected during the procedure, or it will override the color space\
  \ for all external displays?\n\nThanks in advance for your work!"
