comment: 'Hi, I have the same problem with a monitor. Just got the new MacMini M1
  and connected it to my Samsung LC34J791 Wide monitor. And almost fell of the chair
  as to how bad the picture looks.

  So I wanna try this. BUT when I run the script in terminal it says: "No display
  data found! Are any external displays connected?" If I write yes or y then a lots
  of "y"''s are shown in terminal and nothing happens. Any idea as to what I can do?

  PS. The MacMini is connected to the monitor with a thunderbolt cable'
