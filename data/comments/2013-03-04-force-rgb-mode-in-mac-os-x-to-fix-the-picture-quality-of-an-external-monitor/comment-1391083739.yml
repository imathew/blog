comment: 'Yes. I have the Dell S2440L and experience the same problem. The problem
  is the driver for Intel HD 4000 graphics. It has problems with HDMI to HDMI. Some
  people use a Thunderbolt --&gt; HDMI adapter and it works. Other people like me
  use minidisplayport --&gt; VGA and it works. Mine used to go black for a few seconds
  until I switched to VGA.


  Windows has the updated driver from Intel but Mac OS X does not (yet). The same
  problem occurs in Linux.


  Many people are complaining about this on Intel''s and Apple''s websites. I hope
  they will release a driver update to solve the problem.'
