comment: 'Perfect! My Dell U2713HM shows the initial 2560x1440 again on my late13
  RMBP15! Thanks a lot for the script.

  After using FHD-TV on HDMI and then going back Dell on MiniDP and also trying Dell
  on HDMI, the problems begun. Now, after following Bram`s guide and carefully select
  the right Folders, everything is fine again.'
