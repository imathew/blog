comment: I have an Acer Predator XB271HU. Whenever I do this fix, it forces me to
  1024x768 resolution. I try and switch it to 1920x1080 and it just goes blank and
  back to 1024x768. Any suggestions on what to do next? I have a 2012 Mac Mini (2.6GHZ
  i7 Quadcore model). It's a shame this Mac mini is powerful but the display is awful.
  I'm using HDMI to HDMI on this setup. I do not have a miniDP to DP. Also, my gaming
  PC is hooked up to the DP on this monitor. If it's not possible to get this to work,
  I'm selling this Mac mini. It's just taking up space at this point.
