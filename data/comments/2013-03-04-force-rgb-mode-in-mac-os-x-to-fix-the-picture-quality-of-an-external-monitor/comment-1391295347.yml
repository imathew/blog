comment: 'I did see where this was a known issue with Mac Mini''s and an update was
  eventually released.  However, I haven''t seen where any fix were pushed out as
  of 10.9.1.  I am using Intel HD 4000 (rMBP, Early 2013) but wanted confirmation
  that it was across the board.


  Do you have some links to those discussions?  I''m interested in seeing if this
  is the case.'
