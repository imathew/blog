comment: 'Hello,

  Many thanks for your detailed instructions.

  I have copied the executed file into the Overrides folder, renaming the folder to
  be the same as one of the original ones as suggested in the comments. Despite restarting
  this does not appear to have improved the blurriness of the text. Is there anything
  else I can do?'
