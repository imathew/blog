comment: 'I run the script mentioned on this website following the instructions above
  and it worked without problems on Sierra 10.12.1. I copied the RAW script (RAW button
  in the upper right corner of the frame with script text, pasted it to nano, saved,
  and run. No need to worry about the built in display, it is omitted by the script).


  I can easily confirm the effect with my Dell U2515H, which actually displays the
  input mode.


  I did the hack to improve font rendering, which is very nice on retina, but not
  on the external display. Unfortunately, I cannot really see a difference - I guess
  I would need to have a side by side comparison. That said, the screen look fine
  to me now.'
