comment: Thank you Mathew! The picture quality is much better, however I'm still running
  into a slight problem. I'm using a Seiki 48" 1080p 60hz tv as my external and it
  seems like the size is off. The screen is too big for the monitor. When I use display
  preferences, the option to scale the display is no longer there. Any extra help
  would be appreciated. Thanks!
