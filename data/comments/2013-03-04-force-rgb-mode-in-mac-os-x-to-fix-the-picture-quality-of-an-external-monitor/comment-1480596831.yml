comment: 'Hi Marcus,


  Could you break this down into even simpler steps if possible. I have a Mac Pro
  (2013) running Yosemite that I am trying to connect up to an external Full HD monitor
  but the colours and contrast are terrible.


  I am trying to follow your instructions but even "Start by running the .rb script"
  is not easily understood by someone with no programing knowledge at all. Do you
  just double click on it or something more? The same goes for the other steps.


  It would be really great to be able to give this a go so I don''t have to return
  the monitor but struggling to understand the steps right now.


  Many thanks,


  Simon'
