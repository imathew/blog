comment: 'Hi! New rMBP 13" - using my Sceptre 32" LCD HDTV as an external monitor
  - looks horrid: ragged fonts, uneven color.


  HOWEVER, before trying the fix, can you tell me if it is related to the fact that
  the Menu bar starts at a medium gray on the left and varies continuously to a pale
  blue on the right?


  HDMI to HDMI cable (tried 3 - no difference).


  I checked the color Space in the profile after I calibrated the HD 709-A color profile
  in the Displays:Color panel - it said RGB.


  It doesn''t seem to make a difference to select the 1080p vs ''Best for display''
  (or any of the scaled ones, except that I get bigger text at 720p).


  Thanks for your advice.


  When I had this same monitor attached to a Macbook 1,1 running 10.6.8, it was BEAUTIFUL!'
