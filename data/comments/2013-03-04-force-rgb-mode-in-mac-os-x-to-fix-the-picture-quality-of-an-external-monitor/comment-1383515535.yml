comment: 'You can simply drag the newly-created folder into the /System/Library/Displays/Overrides
  folder, or as Mattias wrote in a comment further up you can type the following into
  the command line, replacing the name of the DisplayVendor-10ac folder with the name
  of yours:


  sudo mv DisplayVendorID-10ac /System/Library/Displays/Overrides'
