comment: "Hi,\nI'm a new Mac user and have run into the same issue when plugged my\
  \ rMBP to an HP monitor.  When I followed the instructions to run the patch I got\
  \ the following message after I've entered the \"ruby patch-edid.rb\" line in Terminal:\
  \ \"ruby: No such file or directory -- patch-edid.rb (LoadError)\"\nI already confirmed\
  \ I do have ruby installed (version 1.8.7).  Could anyone help me figure out what\
  \ I've done wrong?  \nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\nThanks,"
