comment: 'Has anyone seen issues after patching with their display intermittently
  going black for a few seconds, then returning to normal?


  I''ve got a Dell S2440L connected to a rMBP that does this every so often.  I''ve
  reseated cables, replaced the HDMI cable, everything and can''t seem to replicate
  the issue consistently or perform any kind of fix.


  I''m now testing it with a Windows desktop in the same configuration and seeing
  no issues.with it.'
