comment: 'Thank you, worked perfectly.  You saved my brand-new mac-mini, I was preparing
  to take it back tomorrow.


  I had the washed-out/too-white color issue, and also the fuzzy-text problem.  My
  new mini was already installed with 10.8.3, so whatever fix is in there did not
  resolve my issue.  Your link and clear explanation did the trick.  I''m using the
  HDMI cable without any adapters, and an LG 1920 x 1080 monitor at 1080p.


  "Instant buyer''s remorse" was absolutely the LAST thing I expected upon powering
  up my new mac mini.  Which only got worse upon reading all of the nonsense posted
  by apple "experts" who have apparently imbibed far too much apple kool-aid over
  the years.  The numerous cheerful suggestions to buy a new Thunderbolt display at
  $1,000 to solve the problem were particularly unsettling.  Thanks for restoring
  some sanity to the matter!'
