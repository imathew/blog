comment: "Hello, mine says this also. It is when I type 'rm -rf /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-472\
  \ and hit enter. \nI receive a message to say 'rm: /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-472:\
  \ Permission denied'.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.\nThanks"
