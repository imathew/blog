  \ into \u201C/System/Library/Displays/Overrides\u201D \nWhen doing this in Finder,\
  \ you'll be asked the password; when copying in terminal or script make sure to\
  \ use SUDO.\nMonitor (Philips Brilliance MultiView 272P4QPJKEB - what a name...)\
  \ working okay again.\nThanks a million for providing such a simple solution!!"
