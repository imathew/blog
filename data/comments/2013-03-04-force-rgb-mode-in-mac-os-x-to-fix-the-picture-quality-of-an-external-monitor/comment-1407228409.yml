comment: I followed all the steps mentioned in this post and it just didn't work for
  my AOC monitor. After more experimenting, I deleted the Overrides-XXX folder, restarted
  the machine again and then it magically picked up my monitor and the sharpness was
  back to normal. I was also fiddling with  my monitor settings (hardware), not sure
  if that helped too. Anyway, might help to someone in similar situation.
