comment: Thanks bigmcguire. Your steps saved my 2nd monitor and my eyes, after upgrading
  to El Capitan. I was furious over not being able to paste to the 'Overrides'  folder
  and had even spent hours with Apple Support to fix it( they were useless by the
  way. All they suggested was to downgrade back to Mavericks!). Thank you again!
