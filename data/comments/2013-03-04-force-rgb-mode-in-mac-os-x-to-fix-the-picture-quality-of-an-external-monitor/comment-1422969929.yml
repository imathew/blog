comment: 'Thanks so much! This worked like a charm on my mid 2011 11" MacBook Air
  and brand new HP 25xi monitor.


  So glad I found this post and didn''t try to buy new expensive cables as suggested
  on forums for nothing!


  More details if it can help anyone: resolution 1920*1080@60Hz, plugged from Mini
  Display Port to HDMI with a $7 Mini Display Port to HDMI adapter + HDMI cable.'
