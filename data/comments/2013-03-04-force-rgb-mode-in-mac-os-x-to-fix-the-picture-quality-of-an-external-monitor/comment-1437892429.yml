comment: "Question:  Have a DELL U2414H and an Apple Thunderbolt Monitor.\n \nI want\
  \ to run both monitors at the same time.  If I run the script, will it effect the\
  \ Thunderbolt Monitor as well or just change the settings on the DELL U2414H monitor?\
  \  \n\nI am using a mac mini 2012.  I can use the extra Thunderbolt out on the monitor\
  \ to daisy chain the monitors and the DELL looks ok, but would rather use the port\
  \ instead for a thunderbolt hard drive.  I would like to attach the DELL to the\
  \ HDMI port of the mac mini and not have the OS X see it as a T.V.  Anyone else\
  \ try to do this?  Will it work and not cause a problem with the thunderbolt monitor?\n\
  \nThose with a mac mini 2012 question:  also, I can use the thunderbolt hard drive\
  \ to daisy chain the DELL monitor and get the system to see it as a monitor and\
  \ not a T.V.  But due to the lesser graphics card in the mac mini 2012 it works\
  \ but system is pushing it.  If I hook up the DELL instead to the HDMI port, does\
  \ it lessen the work on the graphics card since the system was designed to have\
  \ a secondary monitor or T.V. on the HDMI port instead of daisy chaining the Thunderbolt\
  \ port to carry two monitors?\n\nThanks and appreciate the help.  I hope this method\
  \ will make my second monitor look better!!!"
