comment: "Hey Michael, I had the same issues but with another Monitor. Just download\
  \ the script in your download folder or copy 'n paste the script code in a blank\
  \ text document and save it as \"patch-edid.rb\". Then open your terminal and go\
  \ to your download folder (type \"cd Downloads\" if you\xB4re in your User Root-Folder).\
  \ Then run the ruby-Script with \"ruby patch-edid.rb\" and follow the steps 4. and\
  \ 5. from above. That\xB4s all!"
