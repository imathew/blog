comment: 'I couldn''t hate Apple any more for doing this every time they do an OS
  upgrade.


  I''ve been following all the instructions and for me I can''t generated the override
  folder while in El Capitan.  So I''m going to restore to Yosemite and see if I can
  copy to folder to an external drive.  Restore to El Capitan and try again.


  Like tomeek I too have a Dell U2410 and shouldn''t have to suffer like this every
  time Apple does and update!'
