comment: 'Guys, sorry if you have already gone through this, but I still can''t make
  the images on my brand new Dell U2713HM look sharp at all.


  Before doing the "override", there were several resolution options, but the max
  resolution available read "1080p"; now that the Display Preferences show "DELL U2713HM
  - forced RGB mode (EDID) Override", there are only 3 resolutions available:

  - 1920 x 1080

  - 1600 x 900

  - 1360 x 768


  Even after the override, all these options look horrible (blurry); feels similar
  to when I use Airplay do project images from the computer on my AppleTV (and consequently
  to my FlatScreen TV). Seems as if the issue is more connected to the resolution
  than with RGB color...


  Do you guys have any suggestions? What do I have to do to use my DELL Display at
  max capacity (2560 x 1440) with my MacBook Pro?



  Thanks a lot!'
