comment: "I was close to get sick by the ugly ultra-sharpness of my new 21:9 Ultrawide\
  \ Philips 298X4 (2560 x 1080) which was also detected as TV device. Thanks to your\
  \ instructions I can now work with my monitor without getting eye-pain. \n\nThanks\
  \ very much!\n\nBy the way: If you are too lazy to read exactly where to put the\
  \ files then you should not wonder: It does not work putting the override in your\
  \ home library, or somewhere else... *headdesk*"
