comment: 'I have a monitor (LG flatron W2353S 24 inches), a Macbook Pro (Late 2011)
  Model A1278, and a VGA displayport adapter.


  The issue is that when I connect my MacBook to my monitor it detects the monitor
  as a 47" TV.


  The cable works and I can use my 1920x1080 native resolution, but it displays wrong.
  There''s a black large line on the left (like 2 centimeters) and on the right you
  can see that it''s missing a part of the screen.


  I got and very old VGA cable that works well, but i don''t know what''s the difference
  between that cabel and the other ones the i''ve got, I''ve checked them and got
  the same amount of pins, the same voltaje and everyt data in the cable is almost
  the same (except one number that i guess is the serial number)


  Please, if anybody got an idea, i will be glad.


  Thanks.'
