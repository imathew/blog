comment: 'Worked beautifuly for me. I have a Dell U2715H via display port to mini
  display port cable to a 2010 aluminum Mac Pro. On OS X 10.8.5. before the script
  everything looked great except for text which was a little fuzzy and gave me headaches.
  Also i realized on system profilethat the monitor was detected as Television. Wfter
  the script the text looks great, i have no headaches and the monitor isn''t recognized
  as a Television on the system profile.

  Thank you!!

  Btw. if on system profile it says Television:yes i think you have to run the script.'
