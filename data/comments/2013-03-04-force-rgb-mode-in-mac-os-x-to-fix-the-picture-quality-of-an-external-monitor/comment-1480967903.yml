comment: 'My Retina, 13" Early 2015 MacBook Pro seems to have lost the highest "retina"
  resolution on it''s built-in-display. The original EDID file seems to be intact,
  but I''m just having trouble finding the resolution. (Even tried option+clicking
  the "Scaled" radio button and found nothing. Is there a script in existence to bring
  it back?

  Thank you!'
