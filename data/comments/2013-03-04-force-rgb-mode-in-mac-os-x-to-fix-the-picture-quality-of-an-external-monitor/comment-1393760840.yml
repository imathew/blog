comment: I'm using an LG L245W monitor which is known to have incorrect onboard EDID
  data. I have solved this on my Windows computer by overriding it in the nVidia drivers
  so it should be possible on my Mac as well. However, this patch doesn't seem to
  work for me. Can anyone help me in the right direction please?
