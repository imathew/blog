comment: "As expected I lost the RGB on an Acer K272HULbmiidp connected via HDMI when\
  \ I moved from Mavericks to Yosemite. Re-ran the Ruby script (the improved version\
  \ that correctly names the display), put the folder into the right folder as instructed,\
  \ rebooted and... it work like charm. \n\nI really find it quite embarrassing for\
  \ Apple that you have to jump through so many hoops to get things up and running\
  \ but at least it is working as expected."
