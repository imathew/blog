comment: "Just upgraded to Mavericks and can confirm that using 'sudo cp -R DisplayVendorID-xyz\
  \ /System/Library/Displays/Overrides/' works. After a restart my 1080p Visio TV\
  \ looks noticeably better using any resolution. It's still not as crisp as I would\
  \ have expected (Gnome and Windows on the same display look crisper), but it's better.\
  \ \n\nThanks for the tip and I 100% agree w/ your observations about the Apple community."
