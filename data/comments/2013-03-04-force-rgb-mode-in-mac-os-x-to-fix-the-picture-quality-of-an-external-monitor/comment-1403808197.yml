comment: 'Has anyone gotten this fix to work with 10.9.3 and Dell U2414H? Everything
  in settings looks as it should after applying the fix, however the picture is still
  fussy after reboot. Just tried with Windows laptop to make sure I wasn''t just picky,
  but nope - sharpness using Windows is 10x better than OS X.


  Anyone?'
