comment: "Hi Guys, Im on a Mac Book Pro running Mavericks 10.9.5. Im on a AOC monitor,\
  \ through Mini Display Port. Ive just run the script and placed it into my display\
  \ /file/ overide. After restarting, and looking in system pref /displays,/scaled,\
  \ its showing display with forced RGB mode. Is this what people show? Is this correct?\
  \ \nMy font is still not crisp and has some blurriness so I'm thinking I might have\
  \ done something wrong? \nIm also on 1920x 1080."
