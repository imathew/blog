comment: 'Unbelievable! Thanks, skylife88 - I wish I''d seen your comment 3 hours
  ago. That was exactly it - I''d swapped the HDMI inputs around on my SyncMaster,
  and relabelled them accordingly. My rMBP is now plugged into a splitter, and the
  input was labelled HD STB (which is its primary use). I thought it was only a label,
  and not also a function setting! The STB and PS3 which are also plugged into that
  splitter work just fine with its name set to "PC", so now I can breathe a sigh of
  enormous relief.


  Thankyouthankyouthankyou :)'
