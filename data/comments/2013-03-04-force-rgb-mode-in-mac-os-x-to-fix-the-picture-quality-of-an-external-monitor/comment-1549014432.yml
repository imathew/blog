comment: 'Attempted this with a Late 2012 iMac (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680MX 2048 MB)
  running High Sierra (10.13.6) connected to Samsung CHG90 (49" Super Ultra-Wide 3840x1080).


  Not only did I get "acid" screen, but it stretched my screen something terrible,
  and disabled "3840x1080" in both Mac''s native display settings and in SwitchResX
  settings.


  I understand its a lower resolution monitor, but seriously...my eyes hurt typing
  this ughhh'
