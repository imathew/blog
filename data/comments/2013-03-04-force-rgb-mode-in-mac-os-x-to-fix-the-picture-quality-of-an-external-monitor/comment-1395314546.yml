comment: Thanks so much for proving that I do not need any eye test and am not just
  really fussy - was all set to fork out a fortune for the apple monitor as I just
  can't survice using my macbook air 13" screen but was getting no joy with the new
  monitor. Hope it works - am going to try it out on my new Dell monitor when it arrives
  (I took my HP 23xi back as I thought the problem was with my monitor!!)
