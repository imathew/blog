comment: 'No, not at all - don''t erase all the folders! In my case, there was already
  a folder with the name the script created with another file on it. I just moved
  that file to my desktop and replaced with the new one, keeping the folder.

  Today I found out that it must be a balance between your display AND the mac configs.
  I spent some time adjusting the display configurations (white balance, blur, etc,
  etc) and now the image is perfect!


  It is worth giving it a try!'
