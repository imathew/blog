comment: Just wanted to mention that I have a brand new Mac Mini *Late 2014... the
  stores just got them in yesterday) and an HP2509m monitor. I had the blurry font
  problem, and this script fixed it instantly. Thanks to whoever came up with this,
  but I';m having a hard time understanding why Apple hasn't fixed the problem since
  it's obvisouly been going on for so long.
