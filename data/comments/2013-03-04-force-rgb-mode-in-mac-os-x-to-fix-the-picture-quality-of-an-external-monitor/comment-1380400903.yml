comment: 'Thanks a lot. This worked for me also. I have a LG m2280a. When I connected
  it for the first time in a late-2012 mac mini (OSX 10.8.5) with HDMI cable the fonts
  was really blurry and the image was cutted (the top and bottom was "outside" the
  screen area).


  After follow all the steps of this post the fonts are now totally fine and the image
  fits perfectly in screen (1080p) using the same HDMI cable. Just 2 considerations
  about the steps:


  1. Probably you will need to use the sudo command to copy the files. Instead of
  just use cp origin destination, use sudo cp origin destination. System will ask
  you for password.


  2. After restart your computer I opened the System Preferences and in Displays option
  i changed my resolution to something really small (like 800x600) and then to resolution
  I wanted (1920x1080). Just after this the image becames OK.


  It''s really bad that Apple doesn''t fix this problem. It''s not an HDMI cable problem,
  or a monitor problem, or even a driver problem. A little hack fix the issue. But,
  if I want to do hacks to fix this kind of problems I will propably buy a PC and
  install some kind of Slackware Linux.


  But it''s fixed now. Thanks again.'
