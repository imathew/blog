comment: Pleased to say this worked for me. My setup is a Mac Mini with two displays.
  LG Flatron E2290 connected via mini display (thunderbolt) and HP 25xi via HDMI.
  When I first connected the HP, it was awful to work with. I made sure I disconnected
  the LG, followed the instructions and rebooted - worked like a charm. Thanks for
  your help.
