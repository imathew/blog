comment: 'Figured this out -- I''m sure I missed something everyone else saw or knows,
  but just in case anyone else is stuck, here''s what''s up -- I found two library
  paths, Macintosh HD&gt;Users&gt;[username]&gt;Library and Macintosh HD&gt;System&gt;Library.
  Displays/Overrides is in the System&gt;Library path.


  Unfortunately I can''t report success, my Samsung T27C350EW did look sharper, but
  the image is still shifted about 10 cm offscreen.'
