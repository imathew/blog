comment: Even after following these steps and even using the updated script from github
  my monitor still looks terrible (asus ve278q) and it seems to think it is a TV (1080p
  pal/ntsc ).  Anyone have any idea how to fix this ? My eyes hurt and im considering
  just getting rid of the monitor as its painful to read text on it.
