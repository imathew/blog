comment: 'I upgraded to Sierra before remembering I had to do this hack to get my
  old Mac mini to work well with an external display.  So glad this page still exists!


  Here are the steps I had to follow, since I don''t have a Recovery Partition on
  this computer, and Internet Recovery uses a very old version of OS X that doesn''t
  have the csrutil utility.

  1. Download Sierra installer again.

  2. Follow the steps on Apple''s site to make a bootable USB drive.

  3. Reboot and hold down Option and then select the USB drive.

  4. Wait forever for it to boot.

  5. Use the Terminal to run csrutil disable.

  6. Follow the steps above.

  7. Rejoice in my white windows actually being white instead of gray!!!!

  8. Try to remember to re-enable SIP.'
