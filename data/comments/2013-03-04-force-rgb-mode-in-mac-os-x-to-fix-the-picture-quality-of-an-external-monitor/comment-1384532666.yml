comment: Thank you!!!! I was so disappointed after connecting my MacBook Pro Retina
  to a brand new 29" Unltrawide LG Monitor (29EA93).  Initially I used HDMI and couldn't
  get over 1080p resolution.  With the mini DP to DP cable from StarTech I got the
  full native resolution (2560x1080) but the fonts looked horrible. Then I gave this
  script a try. After running the script and copying the created folder to the overrides
  directory and a quick reboot - VOILA! It is gorgeous.  Thanks again!
