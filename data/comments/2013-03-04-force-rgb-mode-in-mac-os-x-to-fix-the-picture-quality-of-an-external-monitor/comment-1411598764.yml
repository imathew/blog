comment: 'The patch-edid Ruby script worked perfectly for me and my dual Dell 2413
  monitors.  Because I have a new (spring 2014) MacBook Pro (with retina display),
  I have one monitor connected via HDMI and the other via Thunderbolt / Display port.  The
  problem affected only the monitor connected via HDMI.


  I played the swap game trying to isolate the problem (swapped cables, swapped monitors,
  swapped MacBooks) ... eventually proving that it ONLY occurs with a Dell U2413 monitor
  connected via HDMI to a new MacBook running Mavericks.  The problem does not occur
  with a) an old MacBook, or b) connection via Display Port, or c) using a Dell U2410
  monitor.


  Thanks again!
