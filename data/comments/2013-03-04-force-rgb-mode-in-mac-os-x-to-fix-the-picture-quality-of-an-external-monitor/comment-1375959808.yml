comment: 'Thanks for the link to fixing this issue. It solved matters on my end as
  well (after I downloaded the right file, since I was too quick and just went for
  the first one at the top of the page to begin with. This is the page with the universal
  fix: http://embdev.net/topic/284710#3027030). Running a 2012 MBP, 15". Mountain
  Lion.

  Thanks again ;)'
