comment: "Oke here is an update, I could not get my second monitor to be less yellowish\
  \ of warm if you will. I contacted Amazon.de and they replaced it with a new one.\
  \ Too bad that this monitor had the same problem. For the record all the U2414H's\
  \ I had (including the good one) where Rev 00. So I contacted Amazon.de again and\
  \ I returned the monitors and got 2 Samsung S24C750 monitors instead. When connected\
  \ they both registered as TV's but the hack on this page quickly fixed that, I connected\
  \ both monitors and they were both on during the hack. Needless to say the Dells\
  \ were crap and the Samsung's are great. There are no H IPS but the are MVA, I think\
  \ there better, their black levels are amazing, its almost like watching an OLED\
  \ display. I can recommend the Samsung monitors to anyone. \n\nSo if your having\
  \ a DELL U2414H that has a yellow glow to it, return that thing and get a different\
  \ brand. :)"
