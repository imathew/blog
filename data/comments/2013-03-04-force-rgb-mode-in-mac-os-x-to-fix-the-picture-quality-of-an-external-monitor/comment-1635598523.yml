comment: Just used the first script to generate the override file for my 2nd Dell
  Monitor.  Found I couldn't mount the MacHD in rescue mode.  Tried using a SuperDuper
  bootable back up for the job, but same issue.  Eventually sussed that I needed to
  disconnect my CalDigit hub, then boot using back up disc, and the rest is history.  Many
  thanks.  (MacBook Pro 13" retina 2013 model)
