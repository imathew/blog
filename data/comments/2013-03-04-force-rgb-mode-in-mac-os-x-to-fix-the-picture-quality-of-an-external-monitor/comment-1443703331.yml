comment: It still works in El Capitan. After installing El Capitan on my MacBook Air
  I was distraught to see fonts all fuzzy again. So I ran the script again and tried
  to copy the override folder but it wouldn't let me copy it. Read the end part of
  the article he has a way to make it work in El Capitan. You have to disable rootless
  mode then copy the script again. I turned rootless mode back on and fonts are sharp
  again. :). Just boot into recovery and run that command in terminal to disable rootless.
  It works.
