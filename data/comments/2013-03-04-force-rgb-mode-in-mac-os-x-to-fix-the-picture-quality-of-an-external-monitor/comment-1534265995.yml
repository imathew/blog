  Had the same problem with a new MacBook Pro 2018 15'''' and an LG 34UC97-S

  Followed Steves introduction: http://www.mathewinkson.com/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor#comment-16073

  Everything works now as expected.


  The funny thing: I did not need this override for my lg monitor until now with this
  new MacBook from 2018. I tried fresh macOS installations on all my 3 MacBooks. One
  from Late 2013 and one from 2017 MacBook Pro 13''''. On the older ones everything
  works fine without override. Very strange... Its a shame to Apple that they do not
  have a fix for this. It took be probably 5 hours to find a solution but every other
  "normal" person without hacking experience hasn''t a chance to fix this.'
