comment: "Worked great for me, thanx!\n\nI have a MacBook Air connected with a minidisplay\
  \ to display port cable from StarTech to a LG 2560x1080 pixel 29EA93 Monitor. After\
  \ connecting the colors looked awful and fonts looked liked they were made with\
  \ LEGO bricks. \n\nNow the colors are so bright I have to wear sunglasses but that\
  \ doesn't matter I 'm very happy. \n\nThis is a much better advice that the Dutch\
  \ Apple helpdesk gave me (as always: clean instal).\n\nVery bad that I have to make\
  \ such changes to the OS myself and Apple doesn't solved this problem in almost\
  \ 9 months...\n\nThanks again for this great article!"
