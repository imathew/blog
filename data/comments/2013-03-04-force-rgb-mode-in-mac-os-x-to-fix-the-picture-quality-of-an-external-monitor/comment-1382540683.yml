comment: I upgraded to 10.9 and when I connected it to my U3014 via a DisplayPort
  I got the problem of bad display quality that I had when I initially connected the
  monitor.The System Report said that the display was a TV (or something like that).
  I went into the /System/Library/Displays/Overrides and saw that the DisplayVendorID-10ac/
  folder was no longer there. I copied it from the corresponding folder in my pre-Mavericks
  Time Machine Backup. Initially it said there was a permissions problem, which isn't
  surprising since the Overrides folder is owned by root and has write permissions
  only for root. I then ran the cp command using sudo and it worked. I unplugged the
  monitor, waited a few minutes, and plugged it back in again. When it came up the
  image quality was good.
