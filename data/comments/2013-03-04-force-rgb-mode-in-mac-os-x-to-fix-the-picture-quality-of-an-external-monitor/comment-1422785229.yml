comment: 'I was about to send my new Acer K272HUL back because the main reason I bought
  it was the 1440 lines in resolution and then I founf this post and it worked: Thanks
  a lot to all the people involved finding the cause and writing the fixes! I ended
  up using Andews ruby script mentioned in his comment above:

  My configuration: Yosemite 10.10.2 on a MacBook Air Mid-2012 with Intel HD Graphics
  4000 1024MB connected with a Mini Display Port to DP cable. I bought both of these,
  both work finally. I only bought the more expensive one because originally I thought
  the cable might be the reason for my limit in resolution:

  Original problem: From the Display settings I could select 2048x1152 and it would
  display the content on my big screen with black borders at 2560x1440 (told by the
  monitor menu --&gt; info). Switching to 2560x1440 in the mac settings would result
  in a totally broken image: Mainly black, some heavily distorted parts of the screen
  on the left third of the monitor.


  Followed the instructions exactly as described and it works like a charm: 2560x1440
  @ 60Hz now!'
