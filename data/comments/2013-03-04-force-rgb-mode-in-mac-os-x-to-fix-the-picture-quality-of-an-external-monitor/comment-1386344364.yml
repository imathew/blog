comment: "Anyone up for walking me through this?   I'm using a Macbook Pro (Mavericks)\
  \ and attaching the HP Pavillion 23xi monitor.  I am on GChat and would really appreciate\
  \ any help.  I get confused when it says download the patch - I get a page with\
  \ code, do I create a file out of that? \nThen it says move the folder, to the home\
  \ directory, but I don't have a folder, just that file.  \n\nThank you..."
