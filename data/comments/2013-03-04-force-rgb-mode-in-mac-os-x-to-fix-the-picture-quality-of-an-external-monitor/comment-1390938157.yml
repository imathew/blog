comment: 'Worked for me on 15 inch late 2011 Macbook pro (10.9.1) connected via DP
  to 29 inch LG 29EA93 (2560 x 1080).


  Not mentioned in the guide but implied... The first time I tried it didn''t work.
  Folder got cleared from overrides when I rebooted.


  Did it again, this time changing permissions on the folder/file to root:wheel instead
  of my user and it worked.'
