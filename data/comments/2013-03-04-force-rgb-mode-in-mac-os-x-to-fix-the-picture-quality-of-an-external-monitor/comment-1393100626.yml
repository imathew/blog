comment: '@Zyg, when you close the lid (clamshell mode) on your MBP, did you try waiting
  for a full 2 minutes to allow the internal switching to occur to transfer the signal
  out to your external monitor? More than one person has been surprised to learn that
  patience is required for this "magic" to happen with a closed lid. Of course, all
  the  proper cables and required adapters must be in play, too. Good luck.'
