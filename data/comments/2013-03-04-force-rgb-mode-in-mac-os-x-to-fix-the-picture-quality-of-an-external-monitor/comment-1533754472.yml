  \ and patch-did.rb files and none of them spitting out anything...\ndifferent errors\
  \ like this one:\npatch-edid.rb:11:in `match': invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 (ArgumentError)\n\
  \tfrom patch-edid.rb:11:in `match'\n\tfrom patch-edid.rb:11:in `'\n\nI've not edited\
  \ any patch files... As I understand it should work when downloaded and no editing\
  \ needed.. or am I wrong?\n\nI'm running High Sierra 10.13.6\n\nI'm trying to connect\
  \ it to my Philips 46\" Flat-TV.\n\nIs there anyone here that can point me in a\
  \ right direction...?\n\nThanks!!"
