  Late 2013 rMBP here.


  I have a korean ips panel ( 27", 2560x1440 ) and i get the blurry text issue.

  The trick above did not work for me.

  The strange thing is that if i put side by side 2 Chrome pages, one running in osx
  and one running in VMWare Fusion linux guest, the Chrome running in VMWare fusion
  displays perfectly crisp text.


  Anybody else has this issue?
