comment: 'Thanks Andrew, I tried to follow your instructions. Not sure if I did it
  correctly, so please confirm if the below seems correct:


  I copied your file and containing folder to the required folder, so that it shows
  in Finder as follows:

  System/Library/Displays/Overrides/gist7435890-66c54c17b179809b028b58a2ca7af0b9540d05b6/patch-edid.rb


  Then I restarted my computer (Late 2014 Mac Mini, running Yosemite including all
  updates). I did not really see any changes, as the fonts still appear blurry on
  the screen (32" LG smart TV, connected with HDMI to HDMI; the TV has no DVI or VGA
  connections).


  In the Display Preferences on my Mac, the resolution is set to "Default for display",
  which is 1080p, and in the color tab I see the following profiles:

  HD 709-A

  LG TV Calibrated [this one I created before; it shows the richest colors]

  SD 170M-A

  Adobe RGB (1998)

  Generic RGB Profile

  sRGB IEC1966-2.1


  Did I take the right steps? I have no idea what a script is supposed to do; was
  I also supposed to double-click on it, beside just copying it to the required folder?


  And am I looking in the right place, under Display Preferences? As I never saw anything
  about YcBcR or something in any of the System Preferences, I don''t know if I am
  trying to apply the right fix here in the first place. Sorry to ask such basic questions.
  I did read through many of the comments posted here, but I might have missed any
  clarifications for dummies.


  Would be great if you could help me optimise my brand new setup with my Mac Mini
  and HDTV!

  Thanks much,

  Leon'
