comment: 'Give Display Menu a blast from the app store, It helped me get native res
  back onto my Bravia via VGA after I switched to Mavericks. Obviously this is nothing
  to do with the RGB mode issue specifically, but may help you among the way.


  Failing that, have a look here https://github.com/vinc3m1/mac-pixel-clock-patch,
  I''m now just Googling here, but found the github link via this interesting YouTube
  video using the 34um95 (who also uses Display Menu with apparently good results)

  Years ago I briefly had a Philip 56" 21:9 TV - amazing for movies, but it physically
  didn''t support anything more than 1080p sadly, would have been amazing for multiscreen
  browsing and gaming if it worked natively, I may have to look at ultra wide again
  when I next upgrade.'
