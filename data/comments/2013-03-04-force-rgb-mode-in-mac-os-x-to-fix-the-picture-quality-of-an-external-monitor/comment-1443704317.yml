comment: "The exact steps I took (to simplify):\n1. Re run the script to generate\
  \ the folder to copy to ovverrides.\n2. You'll notice override in a new location:\
  \ /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides and you can't paste anything\
  \ to it.\n3. Boot into recovery (pressing Command+R repeatedly as Mac reboots).\n\
  4. Go to Utilities --&gt; Terminal and type: csrutil disable. --- Reboot.\n5. Now\
  \ copy the new file created to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides\
  \ overriding the one already there.\n6. (See 7). Reboot. Text is sharp again! \n\
  7. Boot into recovery (press Command+R repeatedly as Mac reboots).\n8. Go to Utilities\
  \ --&gt; Terminal and type: csrutil enable. --- Reboot.\n\nYou now have Rootless\
  \ and sharp text!"
