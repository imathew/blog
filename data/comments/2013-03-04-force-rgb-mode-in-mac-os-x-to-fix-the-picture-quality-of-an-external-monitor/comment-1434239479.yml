comment: 'Hi guys,


  I''m having the same blurry text rendering issue on my new NEC EA274WMi. Connected
  to windows machine it''s perfectly sharp. Connected to a macbook pro retina late
  2012 OS X Yosemite all texts are blurry.


  I used the patch mentioned in this post but it doesn''t work. Once installed it
  forces me to use a lower resolution than the native 2560 x 1440, making everything
  more blurry.


  Already tried with hdmi/DVI/displayport cables, disabling the lcd font smoothing
  and reducing the transparency in System Preferences.


  Who can give me some suggestions?

  Thanks in advance.
