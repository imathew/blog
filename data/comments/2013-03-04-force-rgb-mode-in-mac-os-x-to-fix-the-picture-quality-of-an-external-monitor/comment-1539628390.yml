comment: Should be, hook up your target display again and then open System Prefs&gt;Displays&gt;Color
  and choose the original profile OR go rootless again go to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
  and remove the folder that was added in the first place. In other words, follow
  the steps backwards as it were.
