comment: 'I had the same problem with Yosemite and a Bravia TV.


  Previously I had managed to get SwitchresX to force the correct res, right up to
  Mavericks, however Yosemite does something that negates even this, the best I could
  get was pillar boxing like yourself, so I gave up in the end and rolled back to
  Mavericks after fighting with it for two nights, very frustrating.'
