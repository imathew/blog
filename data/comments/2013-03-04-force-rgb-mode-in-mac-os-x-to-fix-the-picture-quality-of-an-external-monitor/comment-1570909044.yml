comment: I have the same problem as I updated the system to Catalina then my Asus
  monitor became purple again. And even though I disabled SIP and it's no longer available
  to copy the DisplayVendor file to the overrides file... so I tried your method here,
  but it doesn't work as well... it seems that we are not able to revise any codes
  or file that have been installed in the system.
