comment: "I got this working before I upgraded to OS X Mavericks this morning but\
  \ now the override seems to have disappeared and Mac System Report is saying my\
  \ DELL U2711 is \"Television: (Yes)\".\n\nI ran the script and it has created the\
  \ \"DisplayVendorID-10ac\" folder but I can't see \u201C/System/Library/Displays/Overrides\u201D\
  \  in my Library (Library is visible and I have run various \"chflags no hidden\"\
  \ commands in Terminal for the folders). \n\nI can see \u201C/System/Library/Displays/Overrides\"\
  \ in Terminal but when I try to copy the folder over in there I get an error (not\
  \ sure what I'm doing): \n\nrsync -av /Users/[ME]/DisplayVendorID-10ac/* /System//Library/Displays/Overrides/\n\
  building file list ... done\nDisplayProductID-a057\nrsync: mkstemp \"/System/Library/Displays/Overrides/.DisplayProductID-a057.QM32QP\"\
  \ failed: Permission denied (13)\nsent 757 bytes  received 42 bytes  1598.00 bytes/sec\n\

  Hmmmm."
