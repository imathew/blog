comment: Hello. I dont really get this. I have the U2414H display connected to my
  MBP 15" mid-2012 (Display port - Display port) and I see absolutely no problems
  on my screen exept for the info given that it is found as a TV. It also shows TV
  when using Airplay. But the colors and the screen looks fine. is it just me?
