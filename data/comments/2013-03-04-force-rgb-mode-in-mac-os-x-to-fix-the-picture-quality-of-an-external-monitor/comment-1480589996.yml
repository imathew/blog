comment: 'Hi, I found this article and yes it is very painful now.

  I have a Thunderbolt display connected to a Retina Macbook pro and the text is very
  blurry, before that I connected thunderbolt display to a normal macbook pro and
  everything is perfect. But now it looks crappy on Thunderbolt display. Do you have
  any idea of this because it is a thunderbolt display and why Macbook still think
  it is a TV ?'
