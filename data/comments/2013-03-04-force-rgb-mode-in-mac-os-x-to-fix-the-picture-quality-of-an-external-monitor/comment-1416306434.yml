comment: "Hello, I recently bought a DELL 2713HM to use on my MacBookPro 2011 (Yosemite\
  \ 10.10.1) connected through a Mini Display to Display cable. The problem is that\
  \ the colours are off, washed out. The best color profile I have found is 'Apple\
  \ RGB', although it's still not right. \n\nI downloaded and run the ruby script\
  \ and placed the files in the /System/Library/Displays/Overrides, and rebooted by\
  \ these new profiles that appeared (Dell U2713HM EDID override) are just as bad\
  \ as the original. \n\nIs there a way to fix this? Has anyone got the same problem?"
