comment: 'Same thing for me: New MacBook 13" running on Maverick and connected to
  a Benq2400PT 24" via mini dp-dvi adaptor. After one days work I got tired eyes like
  rarely before. Taking a closer look at the display I was pretty shure: "This is
  bad and not normal" You helped me out! It''s a shame that such things do not work
  out of the box! Thanks so much!!'
