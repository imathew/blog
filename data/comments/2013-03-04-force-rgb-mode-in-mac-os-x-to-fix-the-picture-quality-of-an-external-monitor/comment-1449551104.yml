comment: Adjusting for the El Capitan update I navigated to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
  in terminal from recovery mode, however when attempting to copy the generated file
  I get a Read-Only file system error. So, it seems in El Capitan this work around
  does not... work.
