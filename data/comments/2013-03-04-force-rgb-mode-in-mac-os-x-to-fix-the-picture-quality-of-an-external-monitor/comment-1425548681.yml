comment: i would like to add that you CANNOT EXPECT ACCURATE COLORS FROM AN HDMI Connection.
  The first step would have been using the mini -DVI (aka T-Bolt aka mini Display)
  to Display (or DVI) as it allows for the full RGB spectrum (0-255) (HDMI will default
  to 16-235 = no absolute whites or blacks)
