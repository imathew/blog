comment: "i tried it.  Macbook pro mid 2010 with samsung 32\" monitor.  \n\nWhat it\
  \ did was wipe out the speakers in the monitor.  Now i have no sound and an annoying\
  \ 2\" square box with a speaker diagram with an X through it migrating around the\
  \ screen.  \n\nNo difference to screen appearance I can detect.  I can't find the\
  \ display folder or the override folder."
