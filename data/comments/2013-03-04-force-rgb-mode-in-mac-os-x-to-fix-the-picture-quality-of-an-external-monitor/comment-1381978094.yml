comment: Just got a Dell 30" Dell 3014 with the same horrible display!  My old Dell
  Ultrasharp's were always great until the lamps started going.  Hook this up and
  yuck!  Downloaded the patch, ran from terminal which created the folder...which
  I put in the right place.  The patch shows up in the color pref window, but still
  scarmbled text and aweful color.  It's an old Mac Pro tower from early 2008 running
  10.7.5, not sure if that makes any difference.  Any other ways to fix this?
