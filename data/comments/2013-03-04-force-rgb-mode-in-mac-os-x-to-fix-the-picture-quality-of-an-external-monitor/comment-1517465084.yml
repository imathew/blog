comment: "I tried the recommended linked github patch-edid.rb script from TFA, but\
  \ it emphatically does not work whatsoever for my ViewSonic VX 2770 on Mac OS X\
  \ 10.11.6 El Capitan on both my iMac 27\" Retina Desktop using Thunderbolt 2 to\
  \ HDMI cable nor my 2010 Mac Mini using a pure HDMI cable. \n\nHowever, I finally\
  \ found this modified script here https://embdev.net/topic/284710#3027030 that works\
  \ perfectly and preserves the expected resolutions, yay!\n\nBefore buying a new\
  \ cable, please try the modified script from the link above (or use one of the subsequent\
  \ patched scripts in that forum topic for various other monitors.)\n\nGood luck!"
