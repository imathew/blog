  \ to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides.\nb) running \"defaults\
  \ -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing 2\" command \n\nThat did not\
  \ help with my macbook pro 10.11.6 and external hp lp2475w connected via Hmdi to\
  \ Hdmi cabling.\n\nHOWEVER after i ran \"auto scan\" setting on the external monitor\
  \ , the monitor restarted, and afterdwards the fonts were tottaly smooth . Fantastic!"
