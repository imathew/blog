comment: 'The problem is very much present in the latest Mavericks. I confirm that
  this fix works with the new 15" Macbook Pro Retina, Mavericks and Dell U2713H over
  Thunderbolt cable. Without this patch the external monitor was identified as TV
  and was barely usable.


  The fix started working as soon as I copied the created folder to the right place
  (initially I missed this step, though it''s clearly described above ;) ) and re-connected
  the monitor.


  Thank you very much!'
