  The 27" 4K is beautiful! The Retina Screen is beautiful! The 24" blurry .... but
  I use that screen for VMWARE WIN8 and its crystal clear! So I ran across this site....
  I ran the fix, the 24" seems a tad better but something is still off. Using this
  24 on my windows PC it shines but on the Mac it looks blah. Kind of disappointing
  but very happy to have found this site and realize I''m not alone with this issue.'
