comment: 'Did anyone successfully installed El Capitan with a Philips monitor as dual
  display?

  I ask this because I don''t dare to upgrade to El Capitan after someone told here
  that the script didn''t work with Philips monitors (I have the Philips 272C4QPJKAB
  successfully installed using this script on Lion and could do the migration to Yosimite
  without running the script). Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences with
  Philips duals screen on El Capitan!!'
