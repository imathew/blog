  you have to do the following:

  1. download the following file: https://gist.github.com/adaugherity/7435890 (klik
  on the button "download gist")

  2. in your downloads folder, dubbelklik on the file that ends with .tar.gz (a folder
  will be created with patch-edid.rb inside)

  3. move the file "patch-edid.rb" from the downloads folder to your home folder

  4. open terminal

  5. type: "ruby patch-edid.rb" (without " " of course) and press enter. (now a folder
  is created that begins with "DisplayVendorID")

  6. move this folder to Macintosh HD/System/Library/Displays/Overrides

  7. restart your computer


  Now one thing that some of us need to pay attention to is the hardware.

  I could not get it to work with an HDMI cable but it did work with a VGA cable and
  since I have a MacBook Pro 2012 with a Mini DisplayPort I had to use an adapter.

  for the adapter I used and original Apple one: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB572Z/B/mini-displayport-to-vga-adapter


  cheers'
