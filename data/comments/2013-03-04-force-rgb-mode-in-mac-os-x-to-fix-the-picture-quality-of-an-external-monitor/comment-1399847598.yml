comment: 'Hi Friends,


  I''m not certain this fix is what I need, but I''m not a programmer and will need
  someone to counsel me and if it is necessary, walk me thru it. I''m a designer,
  and getting the clearest onscreen image out of the equipment I have is important.


  I have a brand spanking new 13" MBPr running 10.9.2, with an external HP 23bw IPS
  HD 1920x1080  LED display. I''m seeing what I would consider a blurry image on the
  larger remote display. Text for sure is noticeably out of focus. I realize it won''t
  ever be as crisp as the Retina display, but I was hoping that it would be clear
  enough to get my work done on. It really isn''t very good currently.


  The monitor is currently connected directly HDMI to HDMI port using the HP cable.
  I also tried connecting with a Rocketfish TB Mini to HDMI adapter, and see no difference.
  Is there something else I should try?


  Thanks in advance!

  Ivan'
