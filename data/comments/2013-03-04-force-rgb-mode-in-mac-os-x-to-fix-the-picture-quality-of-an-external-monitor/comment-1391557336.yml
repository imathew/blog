comment: I have a HP 25xi IPS and I know it's only 1080p but I didn't remember it
  looking so terrible when I was using my previous Windows laptop.  I was about to
  give in and buy the thunderbolt display but after following the steps and using
  Andrew's edited script the monitor looks ten times better.  Thanks a lot!
