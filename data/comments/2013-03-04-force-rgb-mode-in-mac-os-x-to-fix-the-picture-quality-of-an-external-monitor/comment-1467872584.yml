comment: 'Thanks for the font smoothing trick. The font smoothing trick looked promising
  until I noticed that the apple menu, finder etc (apple related) were fine but other
  applications like firefox, intellij idea were all too bold. Is there a way to keep
  the apple related with font smotthing 3 and other applications to a lesser value
  like 2 or something?


  At the rate my 1080p Lenovo displays, I think I am going to go blind in few days'
