comment: Sierra users - to run this ruby script please make sure that your ruby is
  actually working. Coming from behind 4 osx upgrades my ruby did not, so this script
  did not work, nor give out any meaningful errors withing 5 minutes of looping. Just
  type in terminal "ruby -v" to see if it respons. If not, reinstall/fix ruby and
  it will work.
