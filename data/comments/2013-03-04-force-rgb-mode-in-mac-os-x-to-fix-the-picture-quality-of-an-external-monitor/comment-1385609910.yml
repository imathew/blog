comment: 'I used Andrew''s script, which adds the monitor name. However, my monitor
  name had some garbage characters in it (not sure why), and this actually prevented
  the override file from being loaded - that is, I rebooted and the problem was still
  there. Manually editing the DisplayProductID-... file and removing the junk characters
  from the monitor name fixed the problem and my monitor is now usable. Might be worth
  mentioning, especially for those with a Phillips Brilliance 27" (272P4) monitor.


  Anyways, thanks a bunch to everyone involved here. I''m glad my monitor works. I
  have no clue why Apple won''t just add a little "Television?" checkbox to their
  Display settings. It would save hundreds of people time and money. Ugh.'
