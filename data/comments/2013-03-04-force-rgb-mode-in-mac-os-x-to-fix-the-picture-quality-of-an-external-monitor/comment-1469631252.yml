comment: 'So this used to work PERFECTLY for me, but now since updating to the latest
  version of OS X (10.11.6) it seems to not be working fully. System information doesn''t
  show it as being a TV anymore: http://schoal.es/1lh6R


  But in the display preference pane it''s still only giving me TV resolution:

  I even recently bought a Mini Display Port to Mini Display Port cable to try and
  fix the problem.


  This is so absurdly frustrating, and I don''t know who''s to blame - Apple or Dell
  - but I am ready to pull my hair out (and sell this monitor for one that works reliably).'
