comment: "Thank you so much for the detailed explanation - I was ready to send an\
  \ Acer K272HULbmiidp (using the complete model number to make this page easier to\
  \ find) back after it gave me a horrible grainy picture via HDMI or DIsplayPort\
  \ when connected to a 2013 Retina MacbookPro with discrete NVIDIA graphics. \n\n\
  Generating the RGB override via the Ruby script took 1min and the Acer looks as\
  \ expected - ready for calibration/profiling. Once again two thumbs up!"
