comment: "MBP Mid-2012 non-retina, hooked up with Dell U2414H. GeForce 650M. Closed\
  \ lid, therefore running on the 650M and not the built in graphics.\n\nIm not  sure\
  \ if my screen shows weird colours. Would it be easy to notice? Should text look\
  \ weird too, you say. My screen is found as a TV by OS X, and when I had El Capitanthius\
  \ \"trick\" removed the shown as aTV-problem, but I cant say if the colours, graphics\
  \ etc looks different.\n\nNow using Sierra (not preview), it seems like the settings\
  \ have been restored and my screen is found as A TV again. Did or did it not work\
  \ to do this trick in Sierra, and what is the benefit if the screen shows, from\
  \ what I cat tell, the right colours? \n\nHow to tell if things are OK or not, and\
  \ could it be fixed even in Sierra?"
