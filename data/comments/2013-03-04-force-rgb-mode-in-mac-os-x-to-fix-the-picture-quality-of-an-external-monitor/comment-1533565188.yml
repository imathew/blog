comment: "I was struggling with this on High Sierra and that the new Macbooks are\
  \ formatted APFS. However with the method below I got it to work on a 2018 15\"\
  \ Macbook Pro running High Sierra 10.13.6.\n\nIf you have 2 Macs this is easily\
  \ solved booting the Mac you want to fix into Target Disk Mode and using the another\
  \ Mac to move the files.\n\nMac 1 = The machine I want to fix\nMac 2 = The machine\
  \ I used to move files\n\nThis is what I did.\n\n* On Mac 1, I downloaded the script\
  \ and popped it in a folder on my desktop.\n* Ran the script (with the monitor connected)\
  \ and that created a file in that folder. \n* You should now have a folder called\
  \ DisplayVendorID-* (* will be different for different monitors e.g. mine was DisplayVendorID-1e6d)\
  \ with a text file in it, mine was called DisplayProductID-76db.\n* Navigate to\
  \ /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides and see if you have a folder\
  \ with the same DisplayVendorID-* as you just created. If you don't that's fine,\
  \ go to the next step. If you do, like I did, take a look inside the folder and\
  \ backup the DisplayProductID-* file that you're going to replace.\n* Shut down\
  \ Mac 1\n* I booted Mac 1 up in Target Disk Mode (holding T when starting up)\n\
  * Connected it to Mac 2\n* Moved the file created on the desktop of Mac 1 to the\
  \ /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-* folder\
  \ on Mac 1 (I replaced the DisplayProductID-76db already there)\n* Disconnect the\
  \ Macs\n* Reboot Mac 1 and connect monitor if disconnected. It should be fixed\n\
  \nI hope that helps someone!"
