comment: "apple did shit work here with the thunderbolt - mini display port! mr apple,\
  \ why no bug correction with system update? \n\nI have also some minor bugs with\
  \ my screen - when MacBook Pro goes to sleep, external screen, display this message:\
  \ \"invalid mode\" but everything else seems to work correctly. Obviously there\
  \ is something that does not work 100% ok, but I can't figure out what is this \"\
  invalid mode\" message about... I mean where in the system to look for the info\
  \ about what's wrong. \n\nAny ideas guys? \nThanks so much"
