comment: "I'm afraid I can't remember precisely what my screen looked like (with regard\
  \ to the menu bar colour) other than it was bad, washed out. \n\nI'm also not sure\
  \ if the RGB color profile being selected necessarily means that the Mac is outputting\
  \ the correct color space.\n\nBut considering your monitor was fine on another MacBook,\
  \ I think it's worth a try. You can always revert the changes if they make no difference."
