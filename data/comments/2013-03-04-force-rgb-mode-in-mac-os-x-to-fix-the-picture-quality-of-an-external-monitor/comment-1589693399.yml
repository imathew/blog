comment: I have tried a hundred times. Mine had never worked. Hp 25er I think is the
  model number. 25 inch 1080p. Blurry ass text. After years I've decided to try and
  start building a windows machine. I'm just so sick of this. Apple wants you to use
  its own monitors only that's why they've never bothered to fix this.
