comment: 'I confirm this solution worked for my setup: late 2013 mbp retina with El
  Capitan + U2715H connected via hdmi. Now my monitor shows the input as RGB and there
  is a significant improvement in image quality. Although it is now ok quality I am
  not sure if it is still as good as connecting my windows pc though. Maybe I should
  play with font smoothing.


  Btw, I did not try Peter''s method because I did not see it until I complete the
  fix :) Maybe you can put an information about that up in the instructions.


  Thanks a lot!'
