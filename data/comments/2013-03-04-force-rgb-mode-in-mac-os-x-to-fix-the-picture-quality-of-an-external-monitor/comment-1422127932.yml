comment: 'This helped a lot with an HP Pavilion 27xi 1920 x 1080 LED monitor connected
  to a MacBookPro 13".  It went from horrible to bearable.  I think the rest of the
  problem is related to the pixels being quite spread out on this monitor, which is
  fairly low-res for 27 inch.


  Thank you!'
