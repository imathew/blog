comment: "Hey there, \nI applied this script using a dell u2312hm when using mini\
  \ display port to display port adapter on a haswell retina macbook pro. The monitor\
  \ gets the rgb signal but the fonts still look fuzzy. It's like if one letter is\
  \ sharp and the next isn't. Sometimes I even see like some reddish or bluish shadow\
  \ around some letters. especially when the same letters are following each other\
  \ like : ll or tt. When I zoom in and the font gets bigger, the shadows go away.\
  \ \n\nThe same thing happens when using a mini display port to dvi adapter.\n\n\
  I have put the terminal command to AppleSmoothing -int 2 . \n\nCould it be the monitor??\
  \ The monitor was fine under mavericks connected to my old 2008 macbook pro with\
  \ dvi cable. \n\nI just ordered a viewsonic vp-2770 and im afraid to have the same\
  \ result on such a quality monitor."
