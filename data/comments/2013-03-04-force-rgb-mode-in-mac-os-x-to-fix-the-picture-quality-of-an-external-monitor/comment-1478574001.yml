comment: I have an Acer K272HUL. I just wanted to add that for this display (and apparently
  other Acer displays based on my research) you'll need to change the monitor to use
  DP 1.1 via the monitor's on screen configuration. When running with the display
  in DP 1.2 mode, you'll get RGB color (no more jaggy text), but you wont be able
  to run it at the full 2560x1440. Changing back to DP 1.1 will then give you full
  resolution and a great picture!
