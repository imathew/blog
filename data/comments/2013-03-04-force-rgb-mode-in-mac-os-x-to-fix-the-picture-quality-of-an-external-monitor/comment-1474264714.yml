comment: Hi Michiel, I'm trying to wade through this and looks like I'm getting the
  garbled binary file. However when I try to change the monitor name I'm not sure
  how much of that line to remove. It gives me syntax errors when I try to run the
  script. Any willingness to try and help? I've got a Viewsonic VP2770 I'm trying
  to connect to a rMBP running OS 10.12.
