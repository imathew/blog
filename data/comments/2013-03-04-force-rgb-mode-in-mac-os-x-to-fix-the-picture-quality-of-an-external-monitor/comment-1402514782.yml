comment: 'Hello everyone,


  this is my first post and sorry for my English.


  I bought the Dell U2414H and hooked it up with my MacBook Pro Mid 2009. It has the
  Nvidia GeForce 9400M inside. In near future the display will be connected with a
  2012 Mac mini with the Intel HD4000 inside.


  My question is: how do I recognize that my setup suffers under the problem that
  is discussed here? By now, I can give you following details.


  On the monitor side:


  - I own the revision A00

  - I use the original Display Port to Mini Display Port cable

  - When I first connected the monitor with my MacBook Pro the Display Port Mode 1.2
  was automatically disabled

  - The Dell OSD menu tells me that the monitor is running with RGB input format,
  Mac Gamma and sRGB mode

  - For my eyes, everything looks fine



  On the MacBook side:


  - I runs OS X 10.8.5

  - "About this Mac &gt; Monitor" tells me that I''m using "Monitor: Dell U2414H"

  - "About this Mac &gt; System &gt; Grafik/Monitor" tells me "TV: Yes"

  - "System Preferences &gt; Monitor &gt; Colours &gt; Open Profile" tells me "Colour
  Room: RGB"


  Thank you very very much in advance,

  Martin'
