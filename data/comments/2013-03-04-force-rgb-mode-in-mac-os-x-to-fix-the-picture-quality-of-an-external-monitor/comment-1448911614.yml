comment: "Hi all. I have tried Petes recommendation however I am at a standstill.\
  \ When I restart in recovery mode, I cannot access or see the Macintosh HD. I only\
  \ see the recovery partition. Is there a command or something to change to be able\
  \ to do so? I am new to MACs and have spent a great deal of time on this, and have\
  \ searched til I am blue. Some help would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you. \n\
  JC\n\nAlso, I am using a dual monitor setup. I see two different files created by\
  \ the Ruby Script. Do I need to move both of them? And which override folder do\
  \ I place them in? I am getting weary looking at the blurry text. Thanks again."
