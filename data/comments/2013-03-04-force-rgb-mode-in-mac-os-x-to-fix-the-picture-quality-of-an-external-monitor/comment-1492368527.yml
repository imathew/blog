comment: 'I''ve got the same problem. MacBook Pro Retina Mid-2012, MacOS Sierra 10.12.4.
  Dell 30" U3014 with mini-DisplayPort worked for over a year. Then stopped working
  entirely--monitor says nothing connected, and Mac shows only its own display. I
  suspect it was MacOS upgrades. So I switched to the full size dual-link DVI connection
  on monitor, with dual-link adapter from that cable to mini-DP on Mac. That works
  but only up to 1920 x 1440. I followed the procedures in this post plus the comments
  (thank you everybody!), and like EOL I now see "forced RGB (EDID override)" in this
  display''s preference window. But the max resolution offered still is only 1920
  x 1440 even if I hold down the Option key while clicking the Scaled radio button.


  Dell supports only Windows, which I guess I can understand given Apple''s disinterest
  in providing any support whatsoever for anybody''s monitors but its own. Now that
  Apple no longer sells its own monitors, you''d think Apple would step up support
  for other monitors, but apparently Apple is more interested in selling iPhones.
  Pity.'
