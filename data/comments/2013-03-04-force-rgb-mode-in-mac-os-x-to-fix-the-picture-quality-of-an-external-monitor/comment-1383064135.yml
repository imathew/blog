comment: 'Many thanks for this! I applied this fix on a Dell U2413 connected via mini
  displayport, but the image was extremely blurry and I thought it was applying some
  incorrect scaling. Turns out I''d set sharpening to zero to improve image quality
  some time ago and forgotten about it, bumping it back to 50 brought it back to normal.
  Colours are much improved now.


  Also on Mavericks I found that you don''t need to reboot, simply moving or removing
  the files and power cycling the monitor is enough to enable/disable the fix.'
