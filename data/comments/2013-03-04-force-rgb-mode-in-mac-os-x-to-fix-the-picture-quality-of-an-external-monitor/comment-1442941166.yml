comment: Thank you for this amazing post. I'm glad to hear that I'm not the only one
  facing these issues. I tried your solution, and it created a file and folder, which
  I've added to the Overrides folder, but my monitor still appears blurry. The monitor
  is set to its max resolution of 1080 (I realize this is not terribly high), but
  the fonts are still blurry. Could it just be the monitor itself?
