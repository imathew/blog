comment: 'All Hail King Mathew, All Hail King Marcus


  Thank you so much for providing this info! If anyone lands on this page with hopes
  of getting their Mac Pro Cheesegrater (5,1) up and running on Mojave with Radeon
  RX 560 or RX 580 Metal Compatible graphics cards, I had to alter Marcus'' script
  a little to get it to work. "cp -r" command gave me an "Illegal action" error, while
  "cp -a" worked immediately.


  -bash-3.2# cp -a /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/username/Desktop/EDID-Fix/DisplayVendorID-*
  /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/


  Please note the "\" in front of every spacebar Marcus puts into his script. You''ll
  need to do it to for every spacebar you might have in your finder path.


  For High Sierra, it works just as advertised.'
