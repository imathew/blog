comment: 'If anybody is planning using this patch in combination with pixel-clock
  patch one has to keep in mind, that prior using pixel-clock there is the need to
  remove any previous RGB patches. So every custom folder added to Overrides directory
  should be removed, then apply the pixel-clock patch, and finally the patch-ede one.


  Otherwise, you''ll face a bootloop like this one https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11856987/12868039/b7be90a4-cd0e-11e5-9ef6-9ee97c671bf4.jpg


  PS Confirmed working on mac mini 2012 MD388 with two dell u2913wm over HDMI and
  USB with freed up thunderbolt port for any other use at their full res on El Capitan
  10.11.4 Beta 2 (15E33e), so the code of improved script remains still up to date.
  Many thanks!'
