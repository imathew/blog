comment: Would it possible to use a EDID programmer to help with this issue? We have
  this issue with a projector in one of our conference rooms. The MacBooks or the
  Projector does not correlate the EDID RGB Information and even if we have Auto/Forced
  RGB or YCbCr it think its the opposite signals sent, which makes the picture totally
  wrecked.
