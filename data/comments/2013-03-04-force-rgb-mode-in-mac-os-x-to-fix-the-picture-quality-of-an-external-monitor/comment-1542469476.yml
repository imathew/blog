comment: 'i wanted to say that i think it was an hdmi switch i put in between and
  not the update to Mojave that knocked one monitor back to YUV, since the other (same
  model) was still RGB. To fix the issue i booted to Mojave USB that i created and
  copied the files over after remounting the internal hd as RW mode.


  so i had run the ruby script in regular mode first, just to be clear.


  just in case that helps anyone else.'
