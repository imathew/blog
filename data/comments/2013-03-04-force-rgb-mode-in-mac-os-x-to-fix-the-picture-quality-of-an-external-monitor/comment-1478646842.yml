comment: "Thanks so much for your article. I am running Sierra on a mid-2015 Macbook\
  \ Pro 15\" Retina (OSX 10.12.1), with a brand new (2016 model) Samsung 4K UHDTV\
  \ to work as a monitor. It's a curved 49\" TV so yeah, it's huge, but I'm replacing\
  \ two old monitors with the one for simplicity.\n\nI am a ruby developer and had\
  \ no trouble following your directions and they worked perfectly, though I still\
  \ had to play with the TV advanced picture settings before the fonts looked like\
  \ they should. For some reason the \"Movie\" preset made the fonts look best by\
  \ a significantly visible margin.\n\nBut it's awesome! Your script saved me from\
  \ returning the TV!\n\nThanks again!\n\nSAMSUNG - forced RGB mode (EDID override):\n\
  \  Resolution:\t3840 x 2160 @ 30 Hz\n  Pixel Depth:\t32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)\n \
  \ Main Display:\tYes\n  Mirror:\tOff\n  Online:\tYes\n  Rotation:\tSupported\n \
  \ Automatically Adjust Brightness:\tNo"
