comment: '@Yiftipon, I''m no expert, but it did take some trial and error in following
  the explicit instructions of the procedure to get my external monitor to look good
  and "fly right." Are you getting any errors (might be embedded within a message)
  after running the script on Console? I saw one on my first few attempts and stopped
  to think about what it was telling me. I concluded that I had moved the folder containing
  the Ruby script file, but needed to move only the script file itself so that it
  could be found and run. That took care of all my problems and I have a beautiful
  external display now! Good luck in your troubleshooting...'
