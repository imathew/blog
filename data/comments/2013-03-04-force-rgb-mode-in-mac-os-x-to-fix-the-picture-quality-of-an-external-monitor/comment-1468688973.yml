comment: The patch corrected the problem of OS X recognizing the displays as televisions,
  but the picture quality didn't change for me.  After installing SwitchResX and using
  the settings exactly as described by genriquediaz at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4672999?start=15&amp;tstart=0,
  then the picture quality was perfect.  FYI, my graphics card has two DVI dual-link
  connections and I'm using a DVI-I Dual-Link to HDMI adapter and connecting the other
  end of the HDMI cable to the displays.  I'm using 2560x1080 resolution.
