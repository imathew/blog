comment: 'This is awesome!  Just got a new MBP Retina 15" and using my HP 2509m external
  display was giving me a headache and I have been searching all over for a solution.  When
  I found yours I was worried about editing system files as I am not super comfortable
  doing this.  But I gave it a shot and this solution worked perfectly!  Thank you!


  This is my first Apple computer.  Their devices are amazing but having switched
  from Windows I am repeatedly annoyed with the lack of control over some basic functionality
  OS X.'
