comment: 'FOR THOSE ONES WHO CANNOT SEE THE DISPLAY FOLDER!!!!

  Hi there. Just want to let you know that I got it work just literately following
  the steps as described above. The reason I could not see the "DISPLAY" folder was
  that I was looking at the wrong directory. Yes, there are few "LIBRARY" folders
  in Mac. The first one I looked at was under my username home directory. You can
  access there by going to GO tab in Finder and holding ALT(option) bottom that reveals
  LIBRARY folder. But it''s the wrong one. You need to go to your actual MACINTOSH
  HD drive. Than skip the library folder in there and go to System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides.
  If you have been likeminded (lets call it BLIND-STUPID) than you should solve the
  problem and get your monitor to work properly! THANK YOU!!!!'
