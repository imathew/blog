comment: I don't know if anyone can help me with this however.... I stupidly came
  on here thought I knew what I was doing. So I copied that long ass command this
  into terminal and pressed enter. Now my second monitor is really laggy and grainy.
  Is there a reverse command so I can get it back to normal?
