comment: 'Danilo, I''ve had the same issue with a TV (Bravia 40D3000, see page 5),
  however I suspect, that unless it''s an actual monitor the chances of getting the
  correct EDID is slim to none. Nobody here seems to have success here beyond dedicated
  PC monitors.


  I''ve essentially given up, but Google this issue occasionally in the faint hope
  that Apple get their finger out of their collective arse and fix this.


  Sadly, this is still the number one hit when I search.'
