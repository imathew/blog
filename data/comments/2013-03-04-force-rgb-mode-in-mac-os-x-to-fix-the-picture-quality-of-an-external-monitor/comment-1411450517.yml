comment: This doesn't work for me. I am running OSX Mavericks with a Dell 2407WFP
  and after running the Ruby script, replacing in Overrides, also doing the font smoothing
  with -2, my screen still looks blurry. Very frustrating when this display worked
  perfectly with an older MBP (non-Retina, 10.8) and also works perfectly with Linux.
  I'm going Thunderbolt to DVI-D, I guess I'll try other combinations ... Thunderbolt
  to VGA ... HDMI to VGA ... this is just stupid.
