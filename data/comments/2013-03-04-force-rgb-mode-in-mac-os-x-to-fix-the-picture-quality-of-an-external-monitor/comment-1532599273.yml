comment: "Hi guys, I've tried everything on this, nothing is working. \n\nTwo options\
  \ : \n1/ I'm expecting too much from a 1080p screen (it's the Dell U2414H)\n2/ nothing\
  \ is fixing the problem\n\nThe script worked in the sense that the screen is now\
  \ in forced RGB mode (EDID override) but the text doesn't look any better.\nI've\
  \ taken some screenshots, the difference seems huge (I expected only a small difference)\
  \ and it's only text that seems to be off.\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated\n\
