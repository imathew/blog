comment: "Hi guys, I've tried everything on this, nothing is working.  


Two options  


1/ I'm expecting too much from a 1080p screen (it's the Dell U2414H)  


2/ nothing is fixing the problem  
The script worked in the sense that the screen is now in forced RGB mode (EDID override) but the text doesn't look any better.  


I've taken some screenshots, the difference seems huge (I expected only a small difference) and it's only text that seems to be off.\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated
