comment: Holy crap... this worked. I just got a 15" Haswell rMBP yesterday running
  10.9, coming from a first-gen unibody 2008 MBP running 10.6.8. As soon as I plugged
  my monitor into the rMBP I knew something was wrong. Text looked awful and colors
  were really off... way too saturated. IRC just looked awful.. the bottom curve of
  an "n" in Lucida Grande (12pt, bold) was a complete blur. It was awful. I knew it
  was going to upset me... and then I found this page. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!
