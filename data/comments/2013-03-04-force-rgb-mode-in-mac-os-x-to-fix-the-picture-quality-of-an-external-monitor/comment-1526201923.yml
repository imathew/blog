comment: "For the ones, that have upgraded to APFS with file vault and can't mount\
  \ in recovery mode. The steps are bit different than before. \n 1. diskutil apfs\
  \ list (It should be the drive with role 'no specific role' )\n 2. diskutil apfs\
  \ unlockVolume 'VolumeUUID'\n 3. Enter passphrase of your user account\n 3. Your\
  \ drive will be mounted at /Volumes/\n\nUnfortunately, the fix didn't work for me\
  \ this time on high sierra. Patch worked fine for previous version of mac os."
