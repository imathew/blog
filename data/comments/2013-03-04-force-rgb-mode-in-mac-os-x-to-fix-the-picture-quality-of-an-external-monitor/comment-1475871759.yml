comment: 'Hi - I sent these instructions to someone and they had a little trouble.  For
  step 6, I''d suggest clarifying that they may have to create the Resources and Overrides
  folders.  There is an Overrides directory under a slightly different path that seems
  to be confusing.  Path has to be exact and I think is overlooked sometimes due to
  the presence of a similar path.


  Also, for being able to close your laptop without it turning off, (as suggested
  in step 4), there is a free package called SetResX by Paul Griffin (thanks!) that
  can help accomplish this.  Sometimes hosted on some spammy websites though, so be
  careful.


  These steps work though.'
