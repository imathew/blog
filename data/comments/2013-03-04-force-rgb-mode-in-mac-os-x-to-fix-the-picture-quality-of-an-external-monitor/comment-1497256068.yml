comment: Doesn't seem to work for me. Sierra 10.12.4 with a Dell U2413. Copied the
  patched EDID file to the folder and overwrote the existing file. Rebooted but the
  monitor still defaults to YPbPr mode. System Preferences -&gt; Display shows the
  "forced RGB mode" in the display name. Forcibly setting the monitor to RGB results
  in a purple screen, rebooting the system or restarting the monitor turns it back
  to YPbPr.
