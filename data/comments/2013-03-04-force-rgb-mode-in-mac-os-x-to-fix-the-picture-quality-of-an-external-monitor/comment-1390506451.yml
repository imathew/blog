comment: 'Hey guys,


  I''m using the Dell U2312HM monitor connected with Display Port to Mini Display
  port to my MBPr 13", Mavericks.


  I tried the script, did the whole procedure, in System Preferences &gt; Displays
  the display name is "DELL U2312HM - forced RGB..." still the fonts look quite horrible
  :(


  I tried it with DVI - HDMI cable before with same results and with a MBPr 15" with
  the same result.


  Anyone has an idea how to solve this problem?

  Thanks!'
