comment: As it turns out, although this suggestion fixed the issue with images, font
  rendering on my Lenovo monitor was really bad compared to my retina display and
  even compared to a Windows PC connected to it. I tried all the suggestion for anti-aliasing
  on the web and gave up trying to get my rMBP to work with it :-( If you have any
  suggestion, I'd appreciate it.
