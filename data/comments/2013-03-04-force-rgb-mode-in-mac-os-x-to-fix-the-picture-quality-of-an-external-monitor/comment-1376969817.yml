comment: 'This is embarrassing! I just figured out why the menu bar had a color gradient
  from gray on the left to blue on the right:


  some #$%^@ created a TRANSLUCENT menu bar option - over in System preferences for
  the Desktop (Mt. Lion present to users???) - and the background was not a solid
  (few desktop pictures are), so the gradient came from the DESKTOP, not the MENU
  BAR.


  Thought I''d put that out there in case anyone else had the same problem - because
  it isn''t cured by the patch because it CAN''T be cured by the patch.


  My Sceptre 32" monitor now looks fine - I unchecked the Translucent Menu bar option.
  Sheesh.'
