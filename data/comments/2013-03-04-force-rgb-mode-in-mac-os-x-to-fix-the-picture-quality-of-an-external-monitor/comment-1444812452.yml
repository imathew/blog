  \ and it doesn't work.\n\nI changed the name of the monitor as suggested and that\
  \ enabled me to see the new profile in the display settings but choosing the new\
  \ file did not have any effects on the screen so I'm still dealing with blurry fonts\
  \ and wonky colors.\n\nAfter looking around and googling, this problem seems to\
  \ be isolated to Philips monitors. I can't test the theory but..the fix supposedly\
  \ worked on Philips when running Yosmite but once installing El Capit\xE1n it doesn't\
  \ work anymore.\n\nIt would be amazing if you could find a solution to the problem.\
