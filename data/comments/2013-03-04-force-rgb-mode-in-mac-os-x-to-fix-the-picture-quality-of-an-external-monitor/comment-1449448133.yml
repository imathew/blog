comment: You're my hero, dude! Just got a new monitor and I was having the fuzzy text
  issue, as well as the occasional flicker to black and flashing pixels. There seemed
  to be a woeful lack of support from Apple for the external display issues when I
  searched around, but this solution fixed it right up for me. Thanks for sharing,
  and keeping it so up to date!
