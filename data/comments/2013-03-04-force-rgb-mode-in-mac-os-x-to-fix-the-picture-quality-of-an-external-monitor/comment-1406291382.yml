comment: "I probably have the most stupid question but, it 7 pages are too long to\
  \ see if someone else asked same question. Anyway, I am using late '13 MBP with\
  \ retina display and DELL P2414H. I've connected it via HDMI from MBP to DVI into\
  \ monitor. \n\nQuestion 1 : As I can see here, it is okay to use this cable as hdmi\
  \ to hdmi too ? \n\nQuestion 2 : I am still stuck at downloading this script, since\
  \ I am new to OS X i really hardly understand how to use those scripts. I see there\
  \ is a zip file for one type of monitor but I am not sure what to do with textual\
  \ script that is given and it should work for all monitors. Where to copy that text\
  \ ? If it is text editor, how to name it? Should I place it in folder and zip it\
  \ and copy to home folder ? \n\nIf anyone can be so kind and tell me how to do this\
  \ step by step ?\n\nThank you very much!\nMisa_"
