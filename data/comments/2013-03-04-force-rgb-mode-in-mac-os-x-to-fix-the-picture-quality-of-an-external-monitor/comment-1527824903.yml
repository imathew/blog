comment: "I've tried it all - nothing works with a FHD monitor, regardless of running\
  \ the patch or using every cable under the sun. Looks fine when connected to a PC,\
  \ but Mac? Hell no. After endless research, turns out there's a known issue with\
  \ getting any sort of text quality and accurate colours on an extended monitor if\
  \ you (like me) are running High Sierra v10.13.4 on a Macbook Pro (retina, 15 inch,\
  \ late 2013). \n\nI give up. At least until Apple addresses and fixes the problem.\
  \ Whenever that will be."
