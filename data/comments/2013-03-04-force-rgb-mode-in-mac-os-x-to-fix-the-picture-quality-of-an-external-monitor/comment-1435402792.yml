comment: When I use my Nikon 9000 scanner I need one thunderbolt port on my mac book
  pro for it, the second is used for the display, a Hp 27x. But then I cannot use
  my main harddsik, a thunderbolt WD my passport pro. Tried first Hdmi for my Hp,
  but type was pixelated which gave me a headache, then a docking solution with the
  same result. Tried Hdmi to display port cable I had lying around, did not work either.
  Now tried this patch and yes the display is as good as it was attached to the display
  port! Thanks a lot and shame on Apple! As a late switcher from win to mac I was
  so far very satisfied with the switch (lesser problems with hardware and software)
  but this issue got on my nerves. There is really the danger that Apple is relying
  more on more on golden watches for rich people than on rock solid products for professionals.
