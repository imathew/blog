comment: Freaking that you. To be clear - for one reason or another, the external
  monitor worked great on my Macbook Pro Retina -- until I reset the PRAM. Then it
  had these gamma issues. I updated to 10.9.2 and the problem continued -- until I
  found this thread. Now, no problems. Man what a PITA!
