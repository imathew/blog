comment: "Hi Ni, \n\nDid you find a solution for your LG 34UM95? Mine has just arrived,\
  \ I installed the override correctly (displays the override in System Prefs) but\
  \ now it wont display at full resolution, it is locked to 1920x1080. \n\nWhat cables\
  \ are you using? I'm stuck on Thunderbolt to HDMI until a Thunderbolt cable arrives\
  \ in the post. Even with the override, the text looks blurry and the colours are\
  \ wrong, I'm running it off a late 2012 rMBP. Also, I cant access the Sharpness\
  \ level like you mentioned (it's greyed out in settings?)."
