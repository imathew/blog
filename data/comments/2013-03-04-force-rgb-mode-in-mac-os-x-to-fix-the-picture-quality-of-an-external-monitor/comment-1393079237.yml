comment: I finally got the script to run on my iMac and force the Asus ProArt to be
  non-TV (I called Apple Support, they helped me with the script, told me where to
  place it and run it).  They fixed it back to the original setting, I had made a
  modification that didn't work and couldn't figure it out, the rep fixed the script
  and told me where I need to place it, restarted my machine and it worked.  I still
  had the issue where the text wasn't as good as the iMac, but thanks to @ludwig70.  What
  he recommended for @Bernard got me thinking went into the settings looking for the
  OSD menu, instead found the Splendid menu switch the display to Adobe RGB Mode instead
  of Standard Mode and the text issue went away,  Also tried the sRGB it also worked
  well just the colors were a bit muted.  Hopes this information helps others.
