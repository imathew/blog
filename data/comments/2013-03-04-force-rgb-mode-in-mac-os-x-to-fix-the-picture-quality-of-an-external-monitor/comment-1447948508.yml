  \ the script and run it. Then boot into recovery mode (Command+R) and start Terminal\
  \ from the Utilities menu.\nYour root drive will be mounted under /Volumes/Macintosh\
  \ HD in writeable mode without SIP.\nJust copy the file generated by the script\
  \ to the right folder. In my case it was the following:\n\nmkdir  /Volumes/ Macintosh\\\
  \ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-4c2d\n\
  cp DisplayProductID-902 /Volumes/ Macintosh\\ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-4c2d\n\
  \nand reboot."
