comment: 'I have just installed CS6 on my new ''retina'' display MacBook Pro and unless
  I upgrade to Adobe CC certain apps like InDesign won''t display sharply.


  If I buy a Dell monitor and connect it via HDMI to my MacBook Pro do you think I
  can get rid of these annoying display issues?


  Cheers,

  Michael.'
