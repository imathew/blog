comment: Thanks so much for this. Just bought the HP Pavilion 23fi and turned it on
  to find the fuzziness. after half an hour searching thank goodness I found this
  thread. It worked beautifully and I'm not that technical but I found my way thru
  (funny I only stumbled when trying to find the Overrides directory). So a very big
  THANKYOU.
