comment: 'I did this fix and it works perfectly for smoothing the text on my Toshiba
  24" TV, however the max scaled resolution that I can now output is only 1360 x 768
  so I''m wondering if there''s a way that I can get this back to full 1080p resolution
  like I had before.


  I''m using a 2012 iMac by the way.'
