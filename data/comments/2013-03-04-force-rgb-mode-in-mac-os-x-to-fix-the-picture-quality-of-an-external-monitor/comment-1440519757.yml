comment: Restarting may be un-nessicary.  In Yosmites 10.10.5 with a 2ndary HDMI monitor,
  instead of restarting I disconnected the Monitor's HDMI cable and reconnected it
  and the Font quality improved drastically, though it is still not a clear as my
  built in display.  Note sure if this makes any difference but I already had a /System/Library/Displays/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-...
  with the same number so I only copied in the resultant DisplayProductID-#### and
  left the other pre-existing DisplayProductID-#### files in place.
