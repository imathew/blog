comment: I found that upgrading to El Capitan had wiped out my override on my ASUS
  PA279. It had also changed the background picture to something I used a year ago
  and killed my calibration! Of course I couldn't copy the override folder anymore.
  So I rebooted into recovery mode, opened a terminal in recovery and manually copied
  the folder into the new overrides folder (System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides)
  . In recovery mode, the internal hard disk gets mounted into /Volumes/Macintosh
  HD/ so make sure you take that into account. I would guess that you can also do
  this using a single user boot (hold command-S during a boot).
