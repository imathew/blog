comment: "I tried Marcus' method, but needed a few extra steps because my hard drive\
  \ is encrypted.  In terminal, I had to run\n&gt; diskutil coreStorage list\n\nTo\
  \ get the list of drives. Then picking the final encrypted one in the list, I found\
  \ the UUID and ran\n \n&gt; diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume \n\nThat told me it\
  \ was mounted as /dev/disk17. Finally, I had to run\n\n&gt; mount -uw /dev/disk17\n\
  \nto make the volume writable."
