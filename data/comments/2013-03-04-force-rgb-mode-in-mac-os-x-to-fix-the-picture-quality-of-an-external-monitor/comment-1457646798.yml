comment: 'I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro 15" running Mavericks connected to a LG
  23MP47HQ-P IPS monitor. It is connected through a thunderbolt to HDMI adapter and
  is being recognized as a TV. I''ve run the patch multiple times with no success.
  I''ve gone into the Display Vendor ID file and the LG monitor is being recognized
  and has the correct name in the code. I''ve also tried to edit the display name
  in the patch file (as per Michiel''s comment) before running the terminal command
  but this causes an error in the execution and doesn''t create a new folder.


  Would anyone have any other ideas of what might solve my issue. Did I buy a monitor
  that this patch just will not work on?


  Thanks!'
