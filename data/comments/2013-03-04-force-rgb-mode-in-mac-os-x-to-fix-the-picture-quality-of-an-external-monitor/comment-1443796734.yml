comment: 'The only thing I did different from you was - after step 3 - I restarted
  NORMALLY without immediately enabling Rootless mode. Upon normal reboot, the text
  was sharp on my screen. I then proceeded to enable rootless mode (with another reboot)
  and the text stayed sharp.


  Can you try that? It''s all I can think of at the moment.'
