comment: 'You''re right that Apple has no responsibility to fix the shortcomings of
  third-party hardware. I could have bought a mini DisplayPort cable as you''ve suggested,
  but this was a free and immediate way to maintain the experience that I was accustomed
  to under Windows (and Linux) with the same cable and monitor.


  I disagree that the process is absurd, though. It''s not the ''Apple Way'' to do
  things, but it''s a very simple software mod that produces the desired outcome.
  The [Detect Displays] button does not fix the problem (at least not for me). I shared
  Mr Schwarz''s script since it worked perfectly for me, but readers are free to ignore
  it if they''d prefer to buy the according-to-Hoyle hardware and not delve into the
  command line.


  Thanks for taking the time to respond, I do see your point. And I''m glad you like
  my tagline!'
