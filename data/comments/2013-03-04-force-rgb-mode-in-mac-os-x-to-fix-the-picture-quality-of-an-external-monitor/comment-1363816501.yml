comment: Thanks!  This helped a ton.  I have a new mac mini (2012) and the hdmi output
  was horrific, no matter what adapters I tried (asus vh236h monitor).  10.8.3 did
  not yet fix the issue for me.  It still seems far less crisp than I expect, but
  is at least usable now -- it was quite painful on my eyes before!  I'll keep following
  to see if anything other fixes arise.
