comment: 'Matthew, thank you thank you thank you for digging this up. The blurriness
  issue was driving me crazy! I should have known something was up when I couldn''t
  reproduce the issue on my TV, but the colors on my Asus PA248Q seemed just that
  tiny bit off. This is so much better.


  Thanks again. If you ever should find yourself in San Francisco (or me in your neck
  of the woods), I owe you a lot of beers. (-:'
