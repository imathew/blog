comment: Thank you very much! I tried to solve this problem since September, when
  I just received my MacBookPro. Finally, I can reuse my Samsung monitor without washed
  colors and with a true and deep black! For your information I use an adapter Thunderbolt
  (Mini DisplayPort) - HDMI, and I created a backup of the replaced folder in order
  to test if OSX 10.8.3 fixes the problem.
