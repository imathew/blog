comment: My DisplayVendorId-* folder for my external screen got messed up with multiple
  DisplayProductID-* files in it. I deleted the whole folder within single user mode
  (cmd+s at startup), copied the generated files to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
  and now it works again. Seems to happen after upgrading to high sierra, before that,
  it just worked fine.
