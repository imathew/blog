comment: 'Thanks for the howto.  I used it to fix my Dell U2413, which worked fine
  over DVI (using the HDMI to DVI adapter shipped with my Mac Mini) but had this problem
  with straight HDMI or (mini)DisplayPort.  Note that the monitor shows different
  IDs for each input so you''ll have to re-run the script if you change connections.


  Since updating to Mavericks required my to do it again, I took the time to add some
  features I really wanted to the ruby script:

  * Use the monitor name (taken from the EDID data) rather than the generic "Display
  with forced RGB mode"

  * Multiple display support -- patch the EDID for all connected displays, rather
  than just the first one.  Obviously you only need to install the override file for
  the problematic display, not all of them.
