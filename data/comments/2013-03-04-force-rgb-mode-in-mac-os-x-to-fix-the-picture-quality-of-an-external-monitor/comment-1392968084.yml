comment: "@Bernard,\n1. What shows up when you look at the systeminfo/Video information\
  \ on your macbook (through Apple/About this Mac/More Info/System Information)? Is\
  \ the \"TV\" flag still showing up there, or is it gone?\n2. With me (I have a 27\u201D\
  \ Philips 272C4QPJKAB/00 monitor at 2560\xD71440 as second display on my iMac 27)\
  \ the text looked still blurry after running the script and putting it in the right\
  \ place UNTIL I turned OFF smarttext in the OSD menu on my Philips monitor (resetting\
  \ the monitor through OSD-menu also did the job).\nHopefully this helps...\n\nPS.\
  \ Dit you take a look at this (Tom has a Philips monitor too): Update, 28 Nov 2013:\
  \ If the process appears to work but doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference, consider\
  \ Tom\u2019s comments below. Depending on your monitor an extra tweak may be required."
