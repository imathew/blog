  works perfect for a DELL3014 on a new MacPro


  first i had some issue with the terminal. nothing happend after typing "ruby patch-edid.br".


  i checked the user - set the Administrator again on read+write.


  i verfiy disk permisson - repair disk permisson


  i restart - and the the terminal line works.


  put the new folder into the library like above in the description.


  restart the mac - runs perfect.
