comment: 'Hi There. Need some help


  I forced my IMac to RGB and was pretty good. Now I just bought a HP LP2480zx monitor
  with Color Calibration Solution. Through a AJA T TAP no chance to calibrate but
  using thunderbolt adaptor I tried to calibrate but the program always crash.

  I calibrate this monitor by a laptop and worked fine.

  1. Do I need to worry about the color trough AJA? Is well calibrated?

  2. Should the monitor keep my last calibration?

  3. Is there any chance to calibrate through AJA?

  4. Any bad experience with HP Calibration solution?

  Thank you all'
