comment: 'Francesco, I found the folder Displays in the Library (but there are in
  fact two folders called Library in Mac. Click the Terminal icon until the options
  appear (long click), click the "Go to Folder..." option and then type /system/ and
  you''ll find the Displays folder there.

  Another thing. After running the script, you gotta paste the file into the Override
  folder and erase (or backup to the desktop) the file that was there previously.
  It worked for me, though I''m still facing some pixelated fonts.'
