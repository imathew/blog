comment: 'Thank you so very much for this! I have a Macbook Air 11 2015 and bought
  one of those Display to HDMI adapters. When I connected my Macbook Air to my Dell
  Ultrasharp monitor the text was so fuzzy I could barely read anything. After Googling
  around I found your site. I followed the steps and everything worked perfectly.
  For those still needing help: I had to go into Preferences on Finder to turn on
  the ability to access the Home folder (your Username).'
