comment: I just bought a new 3.0 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i&amp; mini mac and an ultrasharp
  27" dell U2713H monitor. I connected the computer to the monitor with a Mini-DisplayPort-to-DisplayPort
  Cable and get nothing but a "No DVI-D Cable. The display will go into Power Save
  Mode in 5 minutes" message. Can anyone help?!
