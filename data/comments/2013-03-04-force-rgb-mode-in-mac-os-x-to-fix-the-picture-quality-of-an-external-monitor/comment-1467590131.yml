comment: Adding my thanks for this post.  I have a 29" AOC (standard res) monitor
  to which I've employed this fix over several system updates, and it has worked every
  time, including the most recent El Capitan version.  I can confirm the poor display
  quality issue is not due to resolution settings, font smoothing, calibration, or
  drivers (AFAIK none is available in my case -- not sure if any of AOC's monitors
  is designed to work with Mac systems). I used the disable/enable SIPS process but
  skipped the second-to-last reboot.
