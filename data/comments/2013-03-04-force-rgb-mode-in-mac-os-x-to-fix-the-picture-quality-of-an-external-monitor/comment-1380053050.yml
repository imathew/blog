comment: 'Hi Mathew,


  I tried your steps but I am getting this error when I run the script from the terminal:


  $ ruby patch-edid.rb

  ruby: No such file or directory -- patch-edid.rb (LoadError)


  Can you please suggest what I can do about this? I have the patch-edid.rb under
  /users/(my name)/patch-edid.rb


  Thanks!'
