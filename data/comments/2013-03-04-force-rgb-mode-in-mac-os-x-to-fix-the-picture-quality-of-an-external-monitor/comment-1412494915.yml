comment: 'Thank you very much! I used Andrew''s modified script and proceeded through
  all the steps while my MacBook''s lid was closed. After the fix was applied, I re-opened
  my lid and the external screen momentarily flashed black signifying the MacBook''s
  connection.


  When I checked the color space on the monitor''s control panel it was RGB. I didn''t
  have to do a restart, but I assume that''s because the display''s override files
  were reloaded when the lid was opened.


  For reference, I used this on a Dell S2340L (HDMI) and a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 running
  OSX 10.10 Public Beta 4.'
