comment: 'Hi,


  I just wanted to let you know that Peter''s comment concerning SIP is correct. If
  you are in the recovery mode you can do the move or copy operation without any problem.
  No need to disable SIP and re-anable it later. A possible complication is FileVault.
  If FileVault is enabled you have to unlock the System disk. Instructions for that
  can be found in Rich Troutons blog entry https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/using-the-command-line-to-unlock-or-decrypt-your-filevault-2-encrypted-boot-drive/.


  Thanks to everybody that contributed to solve the problem.


  Matthias'
