comment: "For people that have issues with missing display resolutions or refresh\
  \ rates when using the patch, it is because the script deletes all the extension\
  \ blocks in the EDID which holds this data.\n\nI've had success using this modified\
  \ script by Florian H\xF6ch: https://gist.github.com/fhoech/2995242043cd937b5fcb4657d6167c2f\n\
  \nThe override generated by this modified script didn't work for me at first, but\
  \ when I opened the file using a text editor and changed the line IODisplayedid\
  \ to IODisplayEDID it worked. Hope this helps someone."
