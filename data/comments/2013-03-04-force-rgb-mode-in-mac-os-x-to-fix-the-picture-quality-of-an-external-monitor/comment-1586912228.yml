comment: 'This worked for me a few months ago for my MacBook Pro and Dell U2713H


  I think there was an update a few weeks ago and it broke again, the  fixed option
  is still there in the monitor settings, it just doesn''t do anything anymore.


  I''ve gone through the process again, however now I am unable to copy the fixed
  file to the Overrides folder, I''ve disabled SIP but I keep getting a permissions
  error when I try copy or when I try using sudo to copy it in terminal.


  Has anyone else had this happen? It''s quite frustrating that it was working and
  it''s broke again :/'
