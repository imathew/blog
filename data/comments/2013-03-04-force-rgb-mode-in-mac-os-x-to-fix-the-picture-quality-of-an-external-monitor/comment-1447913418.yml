comment: 'BACK AT THE FIRST POST: "When I hooked it up to my Dell U2410 monitor via
  HDMI cable I was shocked by the poor picture quality. The contrast was all wrong
  and text was misshapen. No amount of calibration in the monitor or software would
  fix it. OS X thinks my monitor is a TV, and is using the YCbCr colour space rather
  than RGB. I had to override an EDID setting to force the RGB colour space, and it
  is now working correctly."


  1) What determines why a monitor IDs themselves as a TVs while another monitor ID
  themselves as a RGB monitors?


  2) My 3840x2160 RGB monitor supports audio via HDMI. My laptop HDMI works to a TV,
  but no audio goes to my monitor. My first thought, does the fact it correctly sees
  it as an RGB monitor mean it assumes monitor does not have audio? The monitor does
  show-up under Sound Output as HDMI, but no audio goes to the monitor. Anyway to
  OSX that the monitor does accept audio?


  3) Same problem, but with the monitor connected by Thunderbolt/Displayport 1.2.
  I assue DP supports at least 2 channels of audio, but no audio flows to the monitor.


  4) Somehow OSX 10.9.5 thinks my 3840x2160 RGB monitor has a resolution of 6400x????.
  So the QT Player fits a 3840x2160 video into the center quarter of the screen. I
  can manually make it go Full Screen, but is there some way to tell OSX the correct
  resolution?'
