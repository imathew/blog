comment: 'Hi Guys,


  I used this fix before when connecting my K272HUL to my MBP Retina and it worked
  perfectly. Now I have the monitor connected to my iMac Retina. Has anyone used the
  fix with success? I wasn''t sure if it would work since I can''t have only the external
  monitor working to "force" the override. Cheers.'
