comment: I'm frustrated with my mid 2014 MBP 15 integrated GPU version. I processed
  all steps but still not working with my U2414H. Fonts are blurry as before.  I tried
  all types of HDMI and DP. Not working for both Yosemite and EL Capitan. ECID shows
  it is changed to force RGB mode. Wondering why.... Is the script not working for
  build-in GPU?
