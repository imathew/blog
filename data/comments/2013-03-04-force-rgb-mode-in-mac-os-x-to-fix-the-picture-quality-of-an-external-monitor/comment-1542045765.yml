comment: Thank you so much Mathew and Marcus! I have an iMac 2017 with an additional
  external BenQ Monitor attached (via HDMI and Thunderbolt 3-adapter). After updating
  to macOS Mojave today my BenQ Monitor suddenly displayed in awful pink colors. Thanks
  to your guide now everything is back to normal and working fine! I am beyond happy!
  :-)
