comment: 'Wanted to add my success story and thanks for this thread as well.  I was
  able to fix the display output of a Mac Mini (OS X 10.8.5) on a 29" AOC (has virtually
  no Apple support) using the link you cited.  So far, everything is working as expected.


  This article (and link) saved me from from returning a monitor I wasn''t sure I
  could get working. Again, many thanks.'
