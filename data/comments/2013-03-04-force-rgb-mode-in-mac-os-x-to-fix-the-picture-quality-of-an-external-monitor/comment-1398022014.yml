comment: "Dear Sandergovaers\n\nI just control clicked and chose download. Choose\
  \ \"Go\" \"Home\" from menu bar and drop the file from the downloads into this.\
  \ Then \"Go\", \"Utilities\" and open \"Terminal\" and type \u201Cruby patch-edid.rb\u201D\
  \n\nThanks i reckon. Hadn't had any problem with Asus and LG monitors, just this\
  \ HP Pavilion 23xi. Patch worked brilliantly. Had to switch to lower resolution\
  \ and back again after restart. I have a 2013 MacBook Pro.\n\nThanks again."
