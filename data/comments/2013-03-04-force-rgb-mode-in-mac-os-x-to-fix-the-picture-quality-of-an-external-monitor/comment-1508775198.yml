comment: using a 2016 15" macbook pro on High Sierra and just wanted to say the ruby
  script still works! i thought i noticed a degrade in quality when i hooked directly
  into my HP monitor vs. going through my Elgato (I frequently switch HDMI on the
  monitor between my MacBook and console such as PS3 or Switch). thanks for this!
  i'm not crazy afterall!
