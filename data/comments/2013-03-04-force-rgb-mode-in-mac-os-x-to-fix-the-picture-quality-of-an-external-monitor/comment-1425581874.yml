comment: I sense that I'm still in a different stadium, but this is the closest thread
  I have yet found in my dilemma. I'm using a pair of late '12 Mac Minis with simultaneously
  both HDMI as well as Thunderbolt to VGA video paths. The HDMI works fine, but after
  upgrading from 10.8.6 to Yosemite, everything has gone haywire with my 1080P monitor
  that is down stream from the Thunderport/Displays port. That port is converted to
  VGA which then must pass through a Starview 4port VGA/USB hub. The hub used to be
  "supported" but now is the weak link. The monitor is some industrial (VER G32LW170STD702LGF3)
  nameless brand. I would switch out the hub or try DVI if my Mini wasn't sharing
  a monitor with a Windows 7 embedded computer that works best with that specific
  hub and connectivity. What happens is that the Mini cannot express a full screen
  usage of the monitor (it trims vertically on both sides). I could accept this anomaly
  if 1 out of 3 startups the Finder and Pointer didn't go nuts. The system bogs down
  and cannot function properly even with nothing else running. Apple has replaced
  the logic board twice as wells as both HD's to no avail. Currently I'm going to
  try downgrading to Mavericks to see if the support for my hub still existed there.
  Otherwise it's going to be an admittedly very steep learning curve for me to learn
  more about EDID forcing and exactly what Apple's "Genius" engineers are up to in
  dropping support for such peripherals as my Starview hub. Starview has no updates.
  And Apple simply suggests different monitors and/or hubs. I want them to put the
  older supports back in!
