  maybe this helps?


  You can force OS X to use LCD font smoothing on all displays with this Terminal
  command:

  defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2


  And to restore the default:

  defaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing

  maybe that helps?'
