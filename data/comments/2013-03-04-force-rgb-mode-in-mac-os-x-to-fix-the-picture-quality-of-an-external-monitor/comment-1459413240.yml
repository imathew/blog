comment: apologies. I also later noticed that the string for the Dell U2410 had some
  weird characters. I modified the file using vi text editor and all good now. After
  rebooting, the input colour format on the dell colour settings is now RGB. finally!.
  However, i notice no improvement. the quality and colours are very very good as
  before. Did I have to do this?
