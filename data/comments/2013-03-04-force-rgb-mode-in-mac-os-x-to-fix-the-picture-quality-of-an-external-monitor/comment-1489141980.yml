comment: 'I just wanted to say thanks for this post. It worked for me and I was surprised
  at how good it felt to have a decent image on my external monitor, instead of the
  degraded, blocky mess I was starting to become used to.


  FWIW - I initially couldn''t run csrutil in recovery mode as it wasn''t found. This
  was because I was running the OS (Yosemite) my Macbook had originally been supplied
  with. I upgraded to Sierra and after that I was able to run csrutil in recovery
  mode. From that point on everything went extremely smoothly.'
