comment: I tried this to fix what I thought was a blurry font issue on a new Macbook
  Pro connected to an old-model 27" LED Cinema Display, and it meant that the machine
  crashed on boot, playing the end of the boot chime over and over like a broken record.
  I had to boot into an Ubuntu installer USB stick to undo the change, and then it
  could boot again.
