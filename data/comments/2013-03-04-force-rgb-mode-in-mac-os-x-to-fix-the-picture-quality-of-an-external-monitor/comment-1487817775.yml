comment: "Thanks, worked perfectly with 2016 macbook pro and hdmi cable from the apple\
  \ adapter to dell u2410.  only difference, the destination folder already existed\
  \ ( same name as that created in my home directory ), so I added the generated file\
  \ to that folder.  \n\nfor the person wondering how to undo this, just remove the\
  \ file you added and reboot."
