comment: Troy, did you ever find a solution?  The edid patch isn't working for me
  on my 2013 mac pro.  all text etc is still pixelated like the computer is thinking
  it's a tv.  Wonder if there's a new patch or something that works with High Sierra
  (10.13.6) and this Samsung CHG90 monitor.  I'll have to send this awesome monitor
  back if there's nothing we can do about it.
