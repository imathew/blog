comment: In my case (Macbook Pro 13' Mid 2015 and Samsung 24' LF24T400FHLXZL) the
  steps to force to use RGB worked (which in my case I didn't see any improvement
  so I assume my settings were already as RGB) but I hate Apple for forcing me to
  lower my screen resolution from 1920x1080 to 1600x900 so I could read the text clearer
  and it wouldn't look so pixelated.
