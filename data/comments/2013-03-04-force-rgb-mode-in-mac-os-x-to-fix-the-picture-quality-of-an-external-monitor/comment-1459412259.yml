comment: I have a mac mini MAC OS X 10.7.5 using HDMI cable to DEL U2410. I tried
  running this script and copied to Overrides folder. It makes no difference, Dell
  monitor settings for colour settings colour input mode still shows heavy green hue
  if I set it to RGB and I'm forced to keep it a YPbPr.
