comment: 'I had to do this in Mavericks and Yosemite and then in worked very well
  with the same Macbook Pro and Philips 272P monitor. Now I''ve followed the exact
  steps as described above in El Capitan (including the command+R reboot)  and the
  problem stays: fonts, icons, pictures... it looks awful. Does anyone know why it
  isn''t working here? I''m considering going back to Yosemite :('
