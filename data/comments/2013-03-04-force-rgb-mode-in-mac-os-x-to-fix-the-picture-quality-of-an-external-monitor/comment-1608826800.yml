comment: Same, trying to get my external LG display to work via my Thinkpad Thunderbolt
  3 Gen 2 dock, everything else on the dock works including Ethernet, just not the
  HDMI/DisplayPorts (or just not my external monitor? Not sure which is at fault).  I
  have a brand new M1 MacBook Air, monitor is LG-34WK650-W - I know it recognizes
  the devices, it appears in system info and triggers the screen to turn on, however
  it's just a black screen and then shuts off again :(
