comment: "thanks for the workout!\n\n It really helped with the blurry text, however\
  \ after applying the script and restart it no longer shows my native resolution\
  \ on the list (I have a 29\" Philips Brilliance). Biggest option now is 1920x1080\
  \ and I need 2560x1080. Any hints how to fix that ? \n\nThank you !"
