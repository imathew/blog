comment: 'I hit the same problem again today with a brand new-out-of-the-box Mac Mini
  running OS X Server 10.9.5 and a Dell U2413 connected via HDMI.  I ran patch-edit,
  moved the DisplayProductID to the Override folder, rebooted and presto chango!  Thanks
  again Andrew!


  (I also submitted this problem and the fix to Apple, asking them to fix it in the
  OS so that we don''t have to patch every machine ...)
