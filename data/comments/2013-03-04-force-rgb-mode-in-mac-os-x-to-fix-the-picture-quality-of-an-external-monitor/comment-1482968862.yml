comment: "Marcus' instructions do work. But in Step (2), after you boot into Recovery\
  \ mode, you have to use the \"Disk Utility\" to mount the MacintoshHD volume. \n\
  \nI was confused why I only had \"OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System\" under \"/Volumes\" but\
  \ reading http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/236206/backup-files-from-terminal-in-recovery-mode\
  \ clarified that I need to mount the additional disk."
