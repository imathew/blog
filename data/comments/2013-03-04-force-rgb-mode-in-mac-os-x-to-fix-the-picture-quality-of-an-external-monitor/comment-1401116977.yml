  I can get back to normal by restoring the original folder I backed up from /System/Library/Displays/Overrides.  Anyone
  else ever seen anything like this?  I''m using a pretty new monitor (the LG 34UM95
  21:9 3440x1440).  My understanding was that the script should extract the existing
  profile and just override to force RGB.  Time for some more EDID research I guess.'
