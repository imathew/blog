comment: 'Hi all,


  Could anyone tell me whether the blurry fonts on my LG TV might be due to the colors
  problem you all are discussing here? I am not sure about this myself, since the
  following profiles are all listed in my Mac Mini''s (late 2014) display preferences
  when connected with HDMI to my HDTV:


  HD 709-A

  LG TV Calibrated [this one I created; it shows the richest colors]

  SD 170M-A

  Adobe RGB (1998)

  Generic RGB Profile

  sRGB IEC1966-2.1


  My question: can anyone tell me what is missing from these profiles that should
  be there for the fonts on my display to appear sharper? And so, should I go through
  the procedure described here to fix this supposed colors problem?


  Thanks!

  Leon'
