comment: 'It didn''t work for me on a late 2012 iMac 27" with a Pavilion 23xi. OS
  X version is 10.10.1. It creates me a 1920x1080@60Hz mode, but I still get the same
  results. In case it''s a different issue, what I find is that the desktop size for
  the secondary monitor seems to be the same as for the 27" display, so I only see
  part of the desktop (I have to underscan the secondary screen to be able to see
  the menubar and the dock).


  I''ve ordered a thunderbolt to DVI converter, and I hope it fixes the issue, otherwise,
  I''ll return the monitor.'
