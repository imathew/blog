comment: Just wanted to report I had a similar experience with High Sierra. It made
  me think-- what was the last macOS I installed that had to apply the fix to? I'm
  not positive but it may have not been required for all since this problem was first
  identified. I have not tried the fix yet. I went here first instead.  :)  I will
  try it though and chime in.
