comment: 'You gave me hope!  I went back, redid everything, but this time I moved
  the MDP cable to the Thunderbolt port nearest the magsafe2 port.  Now, it works.  If
  I put it in the second Thunderbolt, the text comes out blurry.  Thanks for confirming
  that this does work.


  I had switched to a DVI dongle for a few days but the monitor wake up has been awful
  so hopefully now all of my problems will be resolved.'
