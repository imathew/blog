comment: I have a Dell U2720Q monitor connected to a 13" MacBook from 2018 via USB-C
  and noticed my black levels are crushed. I tried this fix to force RGB mode and
  the fix is applied (I can see the EDID) however I'm still stuck in "limited range"
  RGB mode where as I need "full range" RGB mode in order to see all the black levels.
  Is there a way to tweak this script to create a version which not only forced RGB
  but also forced "full range" RGB mode?
