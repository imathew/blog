comment: 'Just wanted to give you a giant thanks for this. For three years I''ve been
  trying to get my macbook to play nicely with my HP monitor; fonts were totally unreadable,
  because the monitor was detecting a TV signal and turned on its (annoyingly unmodifiable)
  TV filters. This happened with HDMI and DisplayPort connections, and I ended up
  having to use VGA, which obviously resulted in a blurry display. I was on the verge
  of buying a new monitor, just to fix this problem.


  I just ran the script you link to, and now DisplayPort and HDMI work perfectly.
  Massive thanks to you, and to the author of the script!'
