comment: 'Hello Mathew,


  I''ve just bought my first apple product ever (a 13'''' rMBP) and three hours later
  ended up on your website.


  My DELL 2412m has the "smudgyness" issue, aswel. It is connected via HDMI -&gt;
  DVI. Maybe I should borrow someone''s HDMI -&gt; HDMI cable and see what happens?
  OS X is fully updated and, if I can trust the color sync utility, both the native
  and external display are correctly detected as "display" and the color range is
  RGB. 2412m''s native resolution of 1920x1200 is available and selected.


  I still tried the script you posted about, got the override running, but it had
  no effect.


  Also tried forcing font AA, still no change.


  I know it''s a software issue since booting in windows makes the external display
  look as amazing as it should be, but I''ve no idea where to go next with this..


  Any help would be greatly appreciated.'
