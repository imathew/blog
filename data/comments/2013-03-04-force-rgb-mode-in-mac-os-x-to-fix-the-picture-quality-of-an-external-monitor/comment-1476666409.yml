comment: I'm running Sierra (MacBookPro) and trying to use this solution for my Asus
  monitor. I've downloaded and unzipped the .rb file and placed it in my home directory,
  but when I run the ruby patch-edid.rb in Terminal, nothing appears to happen. A
  new Terminal line appears, and no new folder is created in my home directory. Does
  anyone know what I might be doing incorrectly? Thanks!
