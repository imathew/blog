comment: "Update - of sorts:  This morning I have sound back, I'm not aware of changing\
  \ anything.  I did finally manage to find the systems library and overrides folder\
  \ and get the new display folder pushed in there.  The sound was still out after\
  \ doing that, but it has returned this am.   The display is noted as being forced\
  \ RGB, I don't really notice much improvement.  I have continued to mess with the\
  \ color display calibration and I'm getting closer to a tolerable color mix.   \n\
  \nFirst thing this morning the screen started flashing.  Every few seconds it would\
  \ flash.  I rebooted and it's been fine since."
