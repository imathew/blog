comment: "Hi Michiel et al., \n\nI also got a Philips 272P and ran the script, moved\
  \ the folder to the override folder etc. \n\nHowever,\n(1) When I ran the script\
  \ I wasn't able to close my MacBook Pro Retina: It would not work with the lid closed;\
  \ maybe it is because I am using a HDMI (monitor) to Thunderbolt/miniDisplayPort\
  \ cable (Perhaps I should go out and buy some kind of adaptor... ). \n(2) The monitor\
  \ did change from NTSC to 1920x1080 (in scaled), not the full resolution of the\
  \ monitor, though.\n(3) Name appears as \"Display with forced RGB mode (EDID override)\"\
  \ (I understand this shouldn't be a factor). But I don't get the full resolution,\
  \ which is what matters.\n\nI just ran the script again after seeing your post.\
  \ Here's what I got in the file DisplayProductID-8c5:\n\n\n\n\n\n  DisplayProductName\n\
  \  Display with forced RGB mode (EDID override)\n  IODisplayEDID\n  AP///////wBBDMUI3wAAAA8XAQOAPCJ4Io4FrU8zsCYNUFS9SwDRANHAgYCV\n\

  \n  DisplayVendorID\n  16652\n  DisplayProductID\n  2245\n\n\n\nWere you able to\
  \ get the full 2560 x 1440 resolution? Is this something I can change in the above\
  \ file or it is a matter of cable? Thanks!"
