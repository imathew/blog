comment: "Thank you for your file. Unfortunately it didn't work for me.\n\nI have\
  \ a MacPro (new model) with Thunderbolt to HDMI and a Dell 2711. \nThis setup worked\
  \ with 10.9 Mavericks. I had to press \"Alt\" while \npressing \"scaled\" in preferences\
  \ in order to get 2556x1440 as an option. \nAs soon as I upgraded to 10.10 (currently\
  \ on 10.10.3 beta) the \nresolution went away and the highest I can reach is 1920x1080.\n\
  \nI downloaded all 3 scrips, even the alternative. I put the Ruby file in \nmy home\
  \ folder, run the script, create the new folder with the new text \nfile with I\
  \ name DisplayProductID-a055, restart my computer and nothing. \nI still only see\
  \ 1920x1080 as my highest resolution possible. I am putting it \nin the correct\
  \ folder System&lt;Library&lt;Displays&lt;Overrides\n\nWhat can I be doing wrong?\n\
  \nPlease please help!\n\nThank,"
