comment: This resolved my monitor issue as well. Also, I just upgraded to macOS Sierra,
  and it still works. I have an Acer K272HUL, which is a good monitor, but I could
  not get rid of the jaggy text. This solution worked and the difference is like night
  and day. The text looks absolutely great. I also noticed in my System Preferences
  -&gt; Displays - Refresh Rate is not 60 Hz as before. It is now 59.88 Hz. Thanks
  again to everyone who contributed to finding and posting the solution!
