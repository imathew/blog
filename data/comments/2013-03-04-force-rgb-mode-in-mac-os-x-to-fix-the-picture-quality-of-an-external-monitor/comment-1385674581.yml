comment: Yeah, this is because those apps weren't made specifically for the retina
  pixel density - I have the same problem with a few of my Windows apps running in
  Parallels. It's unrelated to the issue discussed in this blog post, but yes those
  apps then look fine for me when I display them on a regular external monitor.
