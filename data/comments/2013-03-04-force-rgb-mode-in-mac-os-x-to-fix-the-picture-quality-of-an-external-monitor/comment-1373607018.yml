comment: "Thank you, Matthew.\n\nI'll read all the instructions carefully, especially\
  \ the reversion ones.\n\nI'm in the huge process of migrating files by hand - Migration\
  \ Assistant didn't. Just as well - I'm dumping a lot of stuff that accumulated on\
  \ the old machine.\n\nOnce I'm sure I can function in the new environment - and\
  \ have all my mail, etc., and the Time Machine set up, the monitor is next. I don't\
  \ want to get used to my brain doing the work the display should be doing.\n\nYour\
  \ blog is the only one that seems to be posting consistently positive results. I've\
  \ bookmarked it, and will come back and report - and probably blog about it (I'm\
  \ a writer). \n\nIt seems to be a big problem (not driving external monitors correctly)\
  \ - I'm quite disappointed that a Macbook 1,1 (with OSX 10.6.8 - that by itself\
  \ is pretty awesome - I started at 10.4 or something) and an adaptor needed to connect\
  \ to the HDMI on the monitor does a BETTER job than a Macbook Pro running 10.8.4\
  \ and a high speed HDMI cable connecting both directly.\n\nBig step back - and it\
  \ shouldn't be the user's problem to fix it.\n\nAnd Migration Assistant should have\
  \ worked.\n\nAlicia\n\nPS Appreciated the quick response, too."
