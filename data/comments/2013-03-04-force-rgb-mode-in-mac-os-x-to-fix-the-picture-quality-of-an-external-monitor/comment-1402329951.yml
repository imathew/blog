comment: 'well this didn''t work for me.

  I applied the script (i used the improved one which generates monitors name in the
  file) and put it at the correct folder.

  I rebooted and it is still fuzzy.

  And the colour file  itself though is used since my screen now has a title of DELL
  U3014 - Forced RGB mode (edid override).

  It has to do with the 10.9.3 update. I tried to go back to a 10.9.2 version with
  TimeMachine but the restore failed twice.

  So i restored tru a SuperDuper backup to my 10.9.3 version which has this problem
  unfortunately.


  Anybody any ideas here ?'
