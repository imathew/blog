comment: 'I tried this trick with my Asus VX238H and a late 2013 retina 15 but the
  text is still blurry especially on the menu bar.

  However when I open "System preferences" for my display devices, it explicitly displays
  "VX238 - forced RGB mode (EDID override)".

  Do I still have the problem because I directly plug the external screen via the
  HDMI port ?'
