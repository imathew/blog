comment: "Realized my drive wouldn't mount by default because it's a FileVault volume.\
  \ First, look for the \"Logical Volume\" number, grabbing it from the last entry\
  \ with the following command. It's a long string of hex numbers with some hyphens.\
  \ (Not \"Logical Volume Family\" or \"Physical Volume\", but \"Logical Volume\"\
  )\n\n    diskutil coreStorage list\n\nThen, unlock it:\n\n    diskutil coreStorage\
  \ unlock \n\nwhich should also mount it. (If it doesn't, try diskutil mount ). Then,\
  \ make sure you're using the full paths, i.e., \"/Volumes//System/...\" and not\
  \ \"/System/...\" (Matt, that's why you were getting read-only errors: you were\
  \ referring to the Recovery Volume paths."
