comment: 'A minor suggestion: the xml tags in the script on this page are gone, so
  I''d suggest to escape them, so they are displayed correctly or remove the script
  altogether. I ended up copying it and pasting into my emacs and only later, when
  comparing to the existing overrides file that I realized that it was supposed to
  be an xml and saw the comments suggesting to get it from the forum link :-)


  Other than that, thanks so much for this post. I had researched how to get a better
  resolution with MacBook Pro and had not found any good solution until now.'
