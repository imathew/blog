comment: 'This is absolutely pathetic.  I and many others had a fiasco with my MacBook
  Pro graphic board failing and Apple denying there was a problem for a disgusting
  amount of time even though there were massive Apple discussion threads (with very
  rude, dismissive moderators) filled with customers all having the same problem until
  there was a class action lawsuit and Apple finally was forced to issue a recall
  program after wasting countless days and even weeks of their customer''s time who
  were attempting to troubleshoot a problem because Apple was gaslighting them.


  I had my logic board (with the faulty graphic chip) finally replaced by their very
  late recall program after losing a lot of my uncompensated time and money.  Then
  it failed again and they replaced it again after once again having me lose uncompensated
  time and money.  Then it failed again and I told the Apple support guy they needed
  to give me a newer MacBook Pro that didn''t have the flaw.  Apple support assured
  me it was "most definitely" fixed and promised if it failed again they''d then replace
  my MacBook Pro with a different model.  I saw in the discussion threads that it
  wouldn''t work because they never really fixed the flaw and were replacing it with
  the same problem and just hoping their customers would give up and buy a new model.  I
  told support this and they lied that the issue was truly fixed.  It wasn''t.  They
  lied.


  That time it worked for a few years and failed with the exact, same flaw at just
  about the time it surfaced after I initially bought it.  I didn''t even want a new
  Mac at that point and didn''t want to deal with countless hours or days on the phone
  begging them to do the right thing by me.


  I was disgusted by Apple''e hostile behavior towards their paying customers and
  left the platform for Windows.  Now after all these years stupid me decided to give
  Apple one last shot with the 16 inch MacBook Pro.  I try to get Applecare plus for
  it and their sites says my brand new machine isn''t eligible.  After two days of
  phone calls with Apple support I find out it''s a problem on their end and I should
  try again next week.  Not off to a great start.


  Next I plug in the same 4K display that works perfectly with great, sharp text with
  my almost 6 year old Windows 10 laptop (it just works). On this much newer, expensive
  MacBook Pro I struggle to get the same resolution without having to buy a third
  party hack and the text is still blurry.  And now I''m spending my time digging
  through threads like these to see how I can "hack" my Mac to do something that my
  old Windows laptop does by simply plugging in the display and choosing the resolution
  I want.


  Then I look on Apple threads and Apple users are condescendingly acting like this
  is somehow the fault of the users and the displays even thought they work flawlessly
  with Windows 10.


  I''ve yet to actually get anything productive done and still messing around just
  to get basics going to use a 4k display properly without blurry text.  Of course,
  in Apple''s infinite loop wisdom they saw fit to not include an industry standard
  HDMI port on this MacBook Pro so I had to not only spend more money on an adapter,
  I also had to shop around to find a compatible one with 4K and then one that worked
  with 4K at 60hz.


  I''m very much regretting going back to Mac.  I used to love Macs compared to Windows
  because they were much less hassle.  The only reason I went back to trying Apple
  again is I prefer the operating system over Windows 10 in certain respects.


  I''m really hoping this "hack" works but more than that I''m hoping that Mac users
  get back to their roots of being DEMANDING of better quality like they used to be
  a long time ago.  Why are Mac users putting up with this time wasting nonsense?


  I''m already on the edge of returning this MacBook Pro and getting a Windows machine
  and I''ve only had it for a few days now.'
