comment: 'Thanks for your directions, Stefan. I have another question:


  Since I don''t see anything with YcBcR (or so) in the color profiles on my Mac Mini,
  am I actually dealing with the same problem here? These are the color profiles that
  I have now:

  HD 709-A

  LG TV Calibrated [this one I created before; it shows the richest colors]

  SD 170M-A

  Adobe RGB (1998)

  Generic RGB Profile

  sRGB IEC1966-2.1


  Thanks again,

  Leon'
