comment: 'I have a Dell S2415H connected to a 13" Retina Macbook Pro (Early 2016)
  running El Capitan 10.11.4.

  I did the following steps to fix the blurry text which was driving me crazy:

  1. Put the macbook in Clamshell mode

  2. Run the ''Force RGB'' patch

  3. Set Display Profile to ''Color LCD''

  4. Reset the monitor''s settings to default.

  5. run this command on terminal ''defaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing
  -int 3'' and reboot the macbook.'
