comment: 'Thanks you and thanks Tom! I needed this extra step for my Philips 272P4QPJKEB.


  The file generated by the script was a garbled binary file and not a clean plist
  text file. For people experiencing the same problem: you can check this by opening
  the generated DisplayProductID-xxx file in a text editor. You should see a readable
  script. If not, you can modify the patch-edid.rb file on the line that says: monitor_name=[disp["edid_hex"].match
  (...)

  Change it to: monitor_name="Philips 27 inch"

  or whatever you would like to see show up in your Display Preferences screen.

  All fonts are now razor sharp. No more blurry outlines.


  Another tip: if you can''t run patch-edid.rb try: chmod +x ./patch-edid.rb

  This makes the file executable.'
