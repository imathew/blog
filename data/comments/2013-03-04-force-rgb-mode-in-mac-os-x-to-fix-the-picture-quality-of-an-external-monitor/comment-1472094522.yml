comment: 'I got a CX271 EIZO monitor, and when using it in windows bootcamp displays
  pures blacks and pure whites (Full dynamic range 0-255 enabled in nvidia driver)
  while in macosX blacks and white are faded.

  Is there a solution to fix that ?

  I tried to force recognition of my screen and nothing append (just a profile created
  in my display panel in macosx preferences). Blacks and white are always dead.'
