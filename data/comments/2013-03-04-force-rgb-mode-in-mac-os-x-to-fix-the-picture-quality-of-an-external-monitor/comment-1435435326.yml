comment: Thanks a lot! Successfully worked on 10.11 with the new path. Maybe we should
  update the firs post? We need simply disable rootless in recovery, put the output
  folder to the new path overrides and that is it. Also^ for those who want preserving
  the parano-mode we can simply swtich rootless on again from recovery.
