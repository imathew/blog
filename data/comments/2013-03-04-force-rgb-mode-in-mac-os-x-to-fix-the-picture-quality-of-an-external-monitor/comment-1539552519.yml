comment: "Further to my first comment. I need to point out that at first this did\
  \ not work at all. For some oddball reason, the moment I chose \"dot by dot\" for\
  \ the aspect ration I noticed that adjustments to sharpness and color have no effect.\
  \ This tells me that the computer is driving the display with a pure RGB signal\
  \ as it should behave this way. A little surprised about sharpness failing to adjust\
  \ but I think this is due to the \"dot by dot\" aspect ratio setting.\n\nWith respect\
  \ to color calibration I am still able to drive the TV's RGB values independently.\n\
  \nBy the way, all these controls that I am referencing above are from the TV's menu\
  \ itself.\n\nI am still investigating this interesting RGB option but one thing\
  \ is for sure \u2026\n\nPlease check your aspect ratio settings if it's a TV that\
  \ you are testing this on."
