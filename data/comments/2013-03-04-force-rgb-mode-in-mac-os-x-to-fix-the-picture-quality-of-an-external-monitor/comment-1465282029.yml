comment: I am trying to connect a rMBP running Yosemite to a Dell U2414H monitor.
  I have tried everything mentioned here, created the new profile etc. I can see the
  new profile being used in Displays setting but the fonts are still fuzzy. I have
  tried with HDMI-HDMI and mini DisplayPort-DisplayPort connections. That does not
  help either. Does anyone have any more ideas?
