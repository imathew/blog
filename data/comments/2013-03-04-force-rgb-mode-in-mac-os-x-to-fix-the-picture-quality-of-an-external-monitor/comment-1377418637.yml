comment: THANK YOU!!! Was about to maybe try buying a different adaptor to connect
  my 27" iMac to an HP 2509m, then I found this. It works just fine, even though you
  can't turn off the iMac display when running the script. I also just added the folder
  that was created to the already existing Overrides folder (seemed to already have
  several different folders in there, so I thought best to just leave them)... worked
  just fine, no problems, and now my external monitor shows a perfect 1920x1080 res
  with non-jenky text (or at least worlds better than before). Phew. Thanks again!
