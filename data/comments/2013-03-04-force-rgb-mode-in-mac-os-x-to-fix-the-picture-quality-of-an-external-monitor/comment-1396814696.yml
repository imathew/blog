comment: 'One important thing if you have a Samsung SyncMaster monitor!


  * Using the Samsung remote press the ''source'' button

  * Now press the ''Tools'' button

  * Highlight ''Edit Name'' and press the ''OK/Accept'' button

  * Move the selected input to HDMI and press the ''OK/Accept'' button again.

  * Move the selection to ''PC'' and again OK your selection.


  After that, in order to fix any color issues press the Menu button from your remote
  and in the Picture Tab go down to Picture Options and change to these settings:

  *Colour Tone : Normal

  *HDMI Black Level : Normal


  That did it for me! Hope it was helpful.

  Thank you!'
