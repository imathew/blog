comment: "Hm. Not sure if my Dell U2414H is performing worse, but I have some weird\
  \ settings going on in the system preferences for the screen; There 60hz (NTSC)\
  \ is selected, but the screen is 60hz from what I know. But I live in northern europ\xE9\
  , and I think we use 50hz! \n\nI have used the script earlier, and then I think\
  \ 50hz was set to standard. (on earlier mac os version).\n\nBut...I suddenly cant\
  \ find the info in the system telling me it seen as a TV, where is that located?\n\
  Also, the airplay did show me some info about \"Tv\" before, but now its gone. What\
  \ has changed in High Sierra and what to make things work?\n\nThanks. =)"
