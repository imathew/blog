comment: If I recall correctly, when you run the ruby script an override is created
  for each attached monitor. I'm not 100% sure on this, but I presume you can run
  the ruby script and then determine which override represents your external monitor
  before copying just that one to the /System/Library/Displays/Overrides directory.
