comment: "I followed all the steps and I think everything worked correctly. The script\
  \ ran, It said \"found display 'SyncMaster': vendorid 19501, productid 639, EDID:\"\
  \ and then I placed the folder in the Overrides folder. I checked the generated\
  \ file for weird characters but found none. However, I'm not able to see any significant\
