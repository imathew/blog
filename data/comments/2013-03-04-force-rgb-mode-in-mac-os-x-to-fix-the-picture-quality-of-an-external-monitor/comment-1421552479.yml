comment: 'Thanks, this is an awesome feature! works on Yosemite with Mac Mini.


  The only problem with it is that for me is that I cant choose the refresh rate 24hz
  (hertz) in the Mac Display Menu any longer, I could do that before the "fix". The
  only choices are 60hz, 60hz (probably i, interlaced) and 50hz, and that means that
  it will not do 24p any more and therefore it will not automatically change refresh
  rate in media apps like XBMC,Kodi and Plex HT. Any help..? if someone could fix
  it with a 24hz option it would be awesome. I had choices of 60, 50, 30, 25 and 24hz
  before and now I only have 60, 60 and 50hz.'
