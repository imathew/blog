comment: 'I am trying to get this to work on my Benq 27 Monitors and just not getting
  there. The file I create and copy to the folder is not editable with my txt reader
  and therefore I suspect I need to change a part of the source file as per Tom''s
  message, however when I change ANYTHING in this line: monitor_name=[disp["edid_hex"].match(/000000fc00(.*?)0a/){|m|m[1]}.to_s].pack("H*")
  I simply get error messages when running the script. I tried running the ORIGINAL
  script, however display was even worse...I am not sure WHICH bit of that line to
  change to get it working. Any help would be really really appreciated!!'
