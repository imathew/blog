comment: 'I purchased a Gefen DisplayPort Extender over CAT7 only to have it show
  very weird colors when connected to my Retina MacBook Pro. However, it worked fine
  when I booted into either BootCamp Windows or switched to my dedicated Ubuntu box,
  etc. I suspect because OS X kept showing "NTSC" for the display that it "might be
  the problem." Finding this page was AMAZING. Like the author said complex Mac issues
  are hard to get good info on (and I laughably must admit I almost considered throwing
  $1000 at the problem to get an Apple Cinema Display).


  ANYWHO. This worked for me. Wanted to post in case anyone else goes looking for
  display issues with a DP extender. For me with YCbCr it showed everything as a purple
  tint.'
