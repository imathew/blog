comment: 'WOW Thank you so much !


  For the case you are using a encrypted FileVault Drive:


  do the steps of Marcus until the terminal. There you are not able to find your main
  drive.


  with the command: "diskutil coreStorage list" you can list all drives. Search for
  the one where (Revertible : YES most time its the last entry). Then copy the name
  of it with this pattern XXXXXXXX-XXXX-... etc. to the clipboard (cmd+v).


  With the command "diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume XXXXXX-XXXX ..." you can then
  mount the Volume with your user password. After this step continue with the manual
  of Marcus.


  Best regards,

  Martin'
