comment: 'Thanks so much! My MacBook Air 2013 displayed perfect colors (or at least
  not washed-out) via Mini DisplayPort to HDMI, but when I switched to Mini DisplayPort
  to DisplayPort (to output at 2560x1080 resolution natively) for my LG 29EA93, all
  the colors looked crap. Now it''s fixed.


  I''m just frustrated that Apple didn''t make this an easy option that you can tick
  on and off in the settings.'
