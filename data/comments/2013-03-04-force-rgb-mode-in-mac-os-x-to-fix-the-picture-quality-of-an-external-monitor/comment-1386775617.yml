comment: 'Would anybody that has successfully used the EDID override method as mentioned
  above be able to create ''an idiot''s guide'' to downloading and running the patch
  in this forum?


  It would be of massive help to myself and i''m sure those other users that are afraid
  of using Terminal!


  I am using a late 2013 retina MBP and have it connected to a Dell U2413 external
  monitor but the text does not look sharp.


  I downloaded the patch and thought I entered the ''Ruby...'' command properly into
  Terminal but nothing seemed to happen.


  Any help would be much appreciated.


  Thanks.'
