comment: Thanks Pam, but unfortunately that was not the problem. I bought a DVI-to-Thunderbolt
  adaptor and it works fine. I can close the lid, run the script and all. But resolution
  of the Philips monitor is still the 1980 x 1080 (something one can find in a much
  cheaper monitor). Something is wrong. I don't know if running the script multiple
  times will work...
