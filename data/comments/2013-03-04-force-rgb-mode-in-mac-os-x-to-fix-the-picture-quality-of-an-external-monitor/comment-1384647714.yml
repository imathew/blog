comment: 'And here was I, a 2 week virgin to MacBook where the external display was
  my only dissapointment thus far; thinking this would give me the same success as
  everyone else was reporting..but alas, no different before and after for my new
  MBProRetina (Late2103) displaying over HDMI to my Samsung 32" that displays beautifully
  for PC.


  I ran the script, and the monitor preferences shows as the modified EDID RGB profile,
  but no visible difference. Is the problem maybe already solved in Mavericks and
  this is as good as it gets?'
