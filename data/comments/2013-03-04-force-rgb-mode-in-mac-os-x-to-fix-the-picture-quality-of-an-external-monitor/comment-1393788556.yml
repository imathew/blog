comment: 'Has anyone had any success forcing an actual TV into RGB mode over HDMI?


  My 2008 Mac Pro and Bravia 40D3000 connects via VGA, however the time will come
  when I go 1080p, and I''ll be forced to go digital and be unable to avoid the RGB
  issue anymore. I have a DVI-HDMI cable that I never used due to this years ago.


  I tried this last year, the, however I suspect that the EDID info is incorrect and
  is ignored, nothing changed on boot. Just tried today again in a spare moment, and
  now the script doesn''t create anything at all, no idea what has changed to cause
  this. That said I''m no worse off, having never had any success.'
