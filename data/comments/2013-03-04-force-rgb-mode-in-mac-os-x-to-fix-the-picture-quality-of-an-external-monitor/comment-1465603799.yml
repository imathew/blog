comment: So close to getting this working on my Acer K272HUL with my Macbook Air.
  Followed directions to a T, including unlocking the filevault part, but when I execute
  the mkdir command (mkdir /Volumes/ Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-472),
  I get the No such file or directory error. Help please!
