comment: This is the first I've heard about it affecting DisplayPort audio. I would
  suggest you run the ruby script with only the HDMI attached, then backup any existing
  folder with the same name as the one created before putting it in the overrides
  folder. If it affects your DisplayPort audio, revert the changes by deleting the
  new folder (and reinstating the old one, if applicable).
