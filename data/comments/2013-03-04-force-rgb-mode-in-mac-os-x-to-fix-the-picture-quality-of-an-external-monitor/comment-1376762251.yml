comment: 'I just followed the instructions: download patch. Close Macbook Pro lid.
  Run patch with Ruby using Terminal. Restart. Enjoy


  I had a little trouble figuring out how to download the .rb file into my home directory
  because I right-clicked on the script link - the patch - and was presented with
  a menu that didn''t seem to include downloading a FILE. However, CS son informed
  me clicking SAVE A LINK... would download the file.


  Then I played with the settings on the monitor (Sceptre 32" LCD TV, HDMI input)
  until I got a much clearer version of the text than I started with before the patch.
  Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness.


  It is far, far better - thanks.


  However, the menu bar still shades from gray on the left end to blue at the right
  end.


  I can live with this, for now, but would appreciate any ideas on the weird shading.
  I may try one of the adaptors mentioned. If I do, I will report back.


  Thanks for doing this thread.'
