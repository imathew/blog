comment: The image &amp; screen sizes are matched up with the forced RGB display profile.  However,
  the resolution is still on 1920x1080 @ 60Hz.  I'm using the Acer K272HUL as the
  external/primary monitor, what else need to be modified/added in order to output
  the 2,560x1,440 resolution, which is the main reason for my purchasing of this 27"
  monitor?  I'm using an Apple MacBook Pro 13", Early 2011 with elgato thunderbolt
  dock output to HDMI.  Thank you in advance.
