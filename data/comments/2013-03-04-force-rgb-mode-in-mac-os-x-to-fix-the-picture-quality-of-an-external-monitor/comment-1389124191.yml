comment: 'It worked beautifully on my LG27EA28R monitor. I''m connected via HDMI 1.4
  to my 13" retina macbook. Granted the picture and fonts aren''t as crisp as on retina,
  but much better than on tv-like display. Thanks!


  Now my only issue is the ''hatched'' pattern in the lower part of the screen. Any
  solutions?'
