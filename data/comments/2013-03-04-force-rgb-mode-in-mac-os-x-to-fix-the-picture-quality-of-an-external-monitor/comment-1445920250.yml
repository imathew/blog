comment: I disable SIP in recovery mode. I verify status while still in recovery mode
  and is shows disabled. I reboot normally and check csrutil status, it shows SIP
  as enabled and denies access to systems folder to copy my new monitor profile. When
  I reboot in recovery mode and check status, it still shows SIP as disabled.
