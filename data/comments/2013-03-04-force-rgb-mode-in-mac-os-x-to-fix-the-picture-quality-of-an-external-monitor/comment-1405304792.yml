comment: "Hi,\n\n  I have a late model 2013 Mac Pro with the D300 GPUs and an LG 27EA83\
  \ monitor.  I am unable to run the monitor in native 2560x1440 resolution.  My selections\
  \ are limited to 1080p at best.  I have tried the script here, but the monitor then\
  \ distorts with lots of ghosting and the resolution remains at 1080p.  Using a min\
  \ displayport to displayport cable.  Worked great with late model Mac Mini.  I also\
  \ tried switching display port cables and no change.\n\n  I have also tried using\
  \ Apples $99.00 Displayport adapter with dual link DVi cable.  Monitor comes on\
  \ at boot, and it appears to be in the native 2560x1440 when the apple logo first\
  \ shows on the gray background, and then the monitor goes dark.\n\n  I have also\
  \ tried StitchresX and it allows me to select 2560x1440, but the fonts are so fuzzy\
  \ as to be painful in reading.  \n\n  Much thanks to anyone who might be able to\
  \ assist with any ideas.\n\nPat"
