comment: I thought I would have to do this, but I didn't. Instead I used the big fancy
  dual cable Mini Display Port to DVI Adaptor (purchased by my company when the MPB
  was bought recently and didn't work on my 24) to connect to my Dell P2314H as it
  worked fine, and used my partner's spare basic single cable Mini Display Port to
  DVI adaptor to connect my Dell U2413, which was the one that didn't work originally
  on the bigger, fancier MDP to DVI. So now, without having to rewrite anything, I
  have my dual monitors up and running and looking sweet! So, if you don't want to
  fiddle around for hours with the code, ask around and try a few different cables
  and connectors that people have lying around in their desks and cupboards. Worked
  for me, might work for you too! :)
