comment: 'Malcolm: Yes, it works for both SD and HD for me me, BUT something that
  I have only just discovered is that in Australia (where I am) both SDTV and HDTV
  is broadcast in MPEG-2, because the specs were set at the same time (back in 2000),
  whereas the US and UK phased in their approach and went with the superior H.264
  for HD.


  So (depending on where you are) your SD and HD WTV files are probably in different
  formats, whereas my SD and HD files are all MPEG-2. This method is about retrieving
  the core MPEG data in the file, but if the WTV contains H.264 data it would explain
  why it won''t work for you.


  I''ll update this post to say that, but as you said this is getting pretty old,
  now. I''m sure that others have come up with better ways of doing it. Good luck!'
