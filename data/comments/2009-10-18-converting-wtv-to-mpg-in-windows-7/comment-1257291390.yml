  Manually setting the buffer size doesn''t seem to make any difference: as someone
  says in the above link perhaps the copy mode ignores the bufsize flag completely.
  I gave up on the issue because it doesn''t seem to make any difference for me. The
  videos I have produced are fine so far; they run well in MPC-HC in Windows 7 (http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/)
  and on my PS3 via PS3 Media Centre. Is playback any better for you in other programs?


  Anyway, the buffer underflow may or may not be the issue in your case. There could
  be something different about your source file or your version of ffmpeg that wasn''t
  apparent for me. I wouldn''t have thought that the DVB-T stick would be a problem,
  because Media Centre takes the raw input from whatever hardware and produces the
  same type of file. Or maybe it does something that I''m not aware of depending on
  the source?


  This is all just guessing, though. I wish I could help. Please let me know if you
  fix it and/or the buffer underflow warnings.'
