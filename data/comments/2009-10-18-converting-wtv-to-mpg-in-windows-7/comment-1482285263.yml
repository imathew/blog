comment: 'What a waste of space and a piece of garbage, this batch file does nothing.  ABSOLUTELY
  NOTHING!!!!  NO ERROR, NO MESSAGE, NO ACTION, JUST NOTHING!!!!!!


  Why is it so impossible to make a working file out of this bs format that windows
  insists on forcing on us, yet no one else will support?


  Please, for the love of god, idiots, STOP CLOGGING UP THE INTERNET WITH POINTLESS
  GARBAGE THAT DOESN''T WORK AND JUST WASTES MY TIME'
