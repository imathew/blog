comment: 'I know that it''s a long time since you wrote this, but I just stumbled
  upon it today.  I understand what you say, and I specifically want to convert HD
  .wtv files to another format.


  However you describe a 2 stage process - firstly convert to DVR-MS and then convert
  that to MPEG.  But in my experience you cannot right click a HD WTV file and convert
  to DVR-MS (works ok for ''normal'' WTV files.)


  And yet reading your instructions, the convert to DVR-MS does seem to work for your
  HD files - is this really the case?

  Thank you'
