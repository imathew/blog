comment: 'I don''t think this is possible with the .mpg format, which is quite basic.
  If you were to use a richer container format like .mp4 or .mkv you would be able
  to add metadata using the following option (taken from the ffmpeg documentation):


  "-metadata key=value"

  Set a metadata key/value pair. For example, for setting the title in the output
  file:

  ffmpeg -i in.avi -metadata title="my title" out.flv


  There''s probably an easy way to retrieve this data from the .wtv and then use the
  above command to insert them, but I don''t know how.


  I convert to .mpg because of the excellent native performance on the PS3. Rather
  than convert to something like .mkv, which would have to be transcoded, I''d just
  use the original .wtv file. Having no metadata is a tradeoff I choose to make.'
