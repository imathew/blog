comment: 'Hi There,


  This was a TOTALLY helpful post.  The one last barrier I''m experiencing is I''m
  trying to copy the resulting movie file to a USB key to play on my PS3 and some
  of the files are bigger than 4GB (max size supported by FAT32 which is the only
  thing PS3 supports).


  Can you recommend a good MPEG2 splitter program?  I''ve literally tried something
  like 10 of them off the web and none of them have done the job right.  Thanks in
  advance!


  Bob
