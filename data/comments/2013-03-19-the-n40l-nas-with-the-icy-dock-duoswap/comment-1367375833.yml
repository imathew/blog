comment: 'Hah, I actually got that fan before you answered (thanks, amazon prime),
  so I''d like to note that to connect the non-PWM (3-pin) fan to the motherboard
  (which you have to do, otherwise it fails to boot), you have to cut off the far
  header flange (as seen from the case front). Took me a bit to decipher from the
  pinout and your gaffer picture, but it''s the far flange.


  Also, yay quieter storage servers. I''m very happy with this mod now (-:'
