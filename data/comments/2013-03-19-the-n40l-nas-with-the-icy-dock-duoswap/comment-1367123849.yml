comment: 'These modifications look very sensible, thanks! Which non-PWM fan did you
  get? It looks like a Noctua; is it the NF-S12B FLX?


  Relatedly, I''m not sure you''ve already discovered this (I hope you don''t have
  to), but if you''re running TimeMachine backups over AFP, they have a tendency to
  get corrupted. I''ve solved this by exporting an iSCSI volume (this is fairly easy
  if you run FreeNAS, but should be possible on Linux too). OS X then treats it as
  a local disk. That ends up being both faster and more reliable (-:'
