comment: 'Yep, the NF-S12B. You''re still probably better off with a PWM fan, just
  check the minimum speed first, but the Noctua seems to be doing the job OK at the
  lowest RPM.


  Thanks for the Time Machine heads-up! I looked into using it, but I store all non-system
  files directly on the NAS, and I back that up separately. I don''t care about backing
  up system files, but if I ever go that route I''ll use your method.'
