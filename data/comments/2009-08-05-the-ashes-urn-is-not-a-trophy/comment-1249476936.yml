comment: 'Thanks, Neda.


  You''re right, of course. I appreciate the value of a trophy, but in that case it
  really ought to be something that can be lifted by a bunch of players and paraded
  around a field while they spray champagne over each other.


  The problem is that the urn is so well known (and believed to be THE Ashes in most
  cases), that no trophy is likely to replace it in the hearts and minds of the cricket-following
  public.'
