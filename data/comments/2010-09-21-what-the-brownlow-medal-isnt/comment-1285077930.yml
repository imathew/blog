comment: P.P.S. I've heard it said that Judd won because he's the best player in a
  poor team. I can understand the rationale of this statement, but it's a bit of a
  myth. Over the long history of the Brownlow most winners have come from strong teams
  - even great players need the support of a good team if they're going to shine.
