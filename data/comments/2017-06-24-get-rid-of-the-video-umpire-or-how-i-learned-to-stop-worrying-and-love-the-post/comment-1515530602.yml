comment: "The situation is even worse in cricket.  \n\nFirst, the technology isn't\
  \ conclusive as it is mired by a subjective interpretation - decisions are perhaps\
  \ even more controversial when the third umpire's interpretation appears counter\
  \ intuitive.  \n\nSecond, it is subject to manipulation by cricketers which is beyond\
  \ the intent of the DRS - it being implemented to redress an obviously bad decision.\
  \  I recall Tony Grieg was a big agitator for the implementation of technology in\
  \ these situations as he argued players' careers were in the balance, and a bad\
  \ decision could cost a player his place in the team, an absurd notion.  I think\
  \ to prevent manipulation of this kind, reviews could be made but without the use\
  \ of the tracking system, snicko, and hotspot.  The third umpire would essentially\
  \ make a decision in slow time using replays.  Might sound silly, but it would solve\
  \ most obviously incorrect decisions and prevent players 'taking a punt' on decisions\
  \ on the margins.  \n\nThird, take the example of a player given out LBW by the\
  \ on-field umpire, the fielding team decide to appeal, the tracking system shows\
  \ that the ball was only just brushing the stumps and hence the on-field umpire's\
  \ call remains; now hypothetically take the same situation but the the on-field\
  \ umpire's call was 'not out' and the batsman appeals, the tracking system shows\
  \ the ball marginally brushing the stumps as before and as before it is reverted\
  \ to the umpire's call and remains 'not out'.  This for me is the inherent logical\
  \ flaw in the DRS: it allows for a moment in time to split into two alternate realities.\
  \  It's a case of not handing over to the technology completely which is antithetical\
  \ to purpose.  If we trust the tracking system enough to use it then if the ball\
  \ is brushing the stumps then it should be out.  \n\nFourth, it allows fielding\
  \ teams two bites of the cherry.  Take the example of an appeal for LBW that is\
  \ turned down by the on-field umpire, the fielding team appeals and it is found\
  \ that the batsman faintly edged the ball which was caught by the 'keeper.  The\
  \ batsman is given out caught even though the fielding team appealed for LBW.  \n\
  \nFor me I have seen enough to realise that review systems add nothing to the spectacle\
  \ and do nothing to avoid controversy.  Leave the decisions to the umpires and accept\
  \ that sometimes they won't get it right, and that's ok.  Works fine in the BBL."
