These were once available on the Government House website, which hosts selected [speeches of the Governor of Tasmania](//www.govhouse.tas.gov.au/the-governor/selected-speeches-of-the-governor). Currently, the site appears to host speeches of the current governor exclusively.

Despite similar themes in Mr Underwood's 2013 and 2014 speeches, they drew mixed responses from the Tasmanian RSL, with [praise from outgoing president Chris Munday](//www.news.com.au/national/australia-celebrates-and-remembers-on-anzac-day-2013/news-story/bab0da0e7e36e8b7e9ab23aa0b4ac8f2) in 2013, and [criticism from incoming president Robert Dick](//www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/tasmanian-governor-peter-underwood-under-fire-as-anzac-day-address-draws-storm-of-protest-from-veterans-rsl/news-story/37f1cfa878b73d541b1a32e571d6d437) the following year.
