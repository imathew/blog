## January 26
I didn't submit my top ten to this year's [Hottest 100](//www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/16/), since I don't think Australia Day should be celebrated as long as it's held on January 26th. Instead I voted only for _A.B. Original - January 26_. It's an important message, but I also like the tune.
