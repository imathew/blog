_SPIDERS_ moved up my list with each listen, and before I knew it I was playing it every day. I think it's the vocal performance of the year and I'm surprised that it hasn't had the same attention as other songs on [the album](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Only_F**king_Myself).

It's my favourite of Lola Young's songs (ahead of _Messy_ from [last year](/2025/01/favourite-songs-of-2024 "Favourite Songs of 2024") and _Conceited_ from [2023](/2024/01/favourite-songs-of-2023 "Favourite Songs of 2023")).

### Exceptions? ###

_The Space Between_ sees Hannah Frances doing something on guitar that I don't understand but I really love, a careful discordance that reminds me of Stephen Sondheim in the way it evokes a feeling, taking you towards a resolution but never quite getting there. It will be polarising, but I think it's beautiful, and I played it on repeat for a few days.

_One Tiny Flower_ is long, repetitive, and folksy (I think, I don't know genres). Not a description that would usually draw me in, but it speaks to me. In times of stress this year I loved to put it on and chill the fuck out. Thanks, Jeff.

Happy new year, friends.
