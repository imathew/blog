The Last Dinner Party is a revelation. I don't think I've picked three songs from the same group since Chvrches [way back in 2013](/2014/01/favourite-songs-of-2013/).

Many thanks to my love for introducing me to them and Lola Young.

![The five members of The Last Dinner Party dressed for the Nothing Matters video](/img/thelastdinnerparty_nothingmatters.jpg "The Last Dinner Party - Nothing Matters")

1. The Last Dinner Party - Nothing Matters
2. Benjamin Gibbard, Tom Howe - Frightening Fishes
3. The Last Dinner Party - Sinner
4. LP - One Like You
5. The Last Dinner Party - My Lady of Mercy
6. Spanish Love Songs - Haunted
7. Gretel - Cry Me A River
8. Olivia Rodrigo - vampire
9. Lola Young - Conceited
10. Miya Folick - Get Out of My House
11. Nation of Language - Spare Me the Decision
12. Middle Kids - Highlands
13. Dora Jar - Puppet
14. English Teacher - Nearly Daffodils
15. Nice Biscuit - I Feel Love

I don't often list covers but Donna Summer's original *I Feel Love* is one of the first songs I remember blowing my little mind as a kid, and Nice Biscuit's version updates the sound while keeping the vibe. A good chill-out track.

Also, congratulations to Triple J listeners for finally [picking a Mitski song in the Hottest 100](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100,_2023)! It's not your fault that you didn't vote for the [best song of 2016](/2017/01/favourite-songs-of-2016/) back in the day, that's on JJJ for not even playing it. Maybe they had too many *Like A Versions* to promote.
